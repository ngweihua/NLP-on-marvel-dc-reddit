marvelstudios,Spider multiverse and LoKi TVA ...,How does the spider multiverse coincide with the loki TVA?,1623961657,o26yrt
marvelstudios,My guess on how Loki will end and lead into the multiverse,"First up I'm sure I'm not the first person to have this thought so apologies if a million people have said this already.  
So, in episode 1 Loki points out that he didn't do anything wrong and it was the Avengers who messed with the timeline, not him, and it really seems like he's right and no one really gives a different explanation. If the job of the TVA and the Timekeepers is to prevent meddling with timelines and protect the sacred timeline, how can you argue that the sacred timeline is not the one where Thanos won? If the Timekeepers are making an exception to allow the Avengers to stop Thanos because they approve of saving half the universe, how are they different from any other variants messing with time to get the outcome they want?  
Which made me wonder: maybe they're not on the side of the Avengers. Maybe the twist that comes late in the show is that they actually do view the Avengers as variants, and their mission is to undo the events of Endgame and restore the timeline where Thanos won - not because they approve of half the universe being killed, but because protecting the true timeline is their only priority. They have been ok with using Loki as their agent so far because he's a dead man and they intend to put him back in his place in the true timeline when they're done, just like how you can do whatever you want when an apocalypse is coming because it doesn't matter.  
So Loki ends up overthrowing them not out of a desire for power, but because he wants to do the right thing and save the universe. Which I like because it lets him have a redemption arc and act as a good guy while still staying true to his nature as an agent of chaos. And then without the Timekeepers/TVA running things, there's no one to stop the different timelines/multiverses running rampant, which is how we end up multiverse shenanigans in Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home.",1623961646,o26ymh
marvelstudios,Excuse me what? Partial rant,Ok so we watched the first episode of loki and he ended up somewhere with a different language that he was not accustomed to/didn't know and then we go to episode 2 where HE SPEAKS LATIN??? Isn't that a more infrequent language used on earth??? I remember in infinity war thor spoke groot and he said that was an elective. So does that mean Loki took Latin as an elective?

&gt;[\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 shows exactly why Natasha Romanoff was the glue that held the Avengers together. Shades of John Wick fight scenes &amp; inventive action sequences wrapped in a heartfelt &amp; poignant story about family &amp; how the world treats girls. Excited to see Yelena carry the torch.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yelena will be a new fan-favorite after [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 too. Florence Pugh knocked it out of the park. She and Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal together as two ""sisters"" used and abused by a system they need to break.

[:Steven Weintraub:](https://twitter.com/colliderfrosty/status/1405555888379678723?s=20)

&gt;Cate Shortland had the difficult job trying to fill in Natasha Romanoff’s backstory, but she nailed it in [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷. While entire cast was great both [@Florence\_Pugh](https://twitter.com/Florence_Pugh) and [@DavidKHarbour](https://twitter.com/DavidKHarbour) hit home-runs with their performances. No way audiences don’t want more of both characters.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also the action is non-stop in [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 and so well done. And if you like it, you can thank 2nd unit director Darrin Prescott. You know his work from the ‘John Wick’ movies, ‘Black Panther,’ and ‘Captain America: Civil War.’ Don’t watch on Disney+. See this in a movie theater.

&gt;The development of characters not named Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, or Thor in Phase 4 of the MCU has been great.  First Wanda and Vision, then Sam and Bucky. [\#Loki](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Loki?src=hashtag_click)📷 is in the process.  [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 keeps that up really nicely.

[:Erik Davis:](https://twitter.com/ErikDavis/status/1405555837913944071?s=20)

&gt;Marvel movies are back! #BlackWidow is a tense, action-packed spy thriller that truly completes Natasha’s story in a visceral &amp; emotional way. Florence Pugh CRUSHES it &amp; is an instant MCU icon. This is like the MCU's Bond movie w/ shades of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE &amp; THELMA &amp; LOUISE.  
&gt;  
&gt;A few other notes: - Yes, there's a post-credits scene, so stick around. - David Harbour is hilarious &amp; a major scene stealer - Takes place after CIVIL WAR, so lots of Avengers references. - If this is Scarlett's final performance as Natasha, it's a great way to go out  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, the thing that hit me the most was the action. There are several BIG action sequences in [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 &amp; it immediately separates itself from the TV shows, which are softer on action &amp; heavier on character. I missed big Marvel action. It's a fun ride.

[:Perri Nemiroff:](https://twitter.com/PNemiroff/status/1405556556381446157?s=20)

&gt;Dug [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 a good deal! Was kinda worried about watching this story unfold knowing what’s to come in Endgame, that it might diminish the stakes, but that wasn’t the case. In fact, this is the kind of prequel story that feels bound to enhance other installments of the MCU.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lots I loved in [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 but the standout component is that ensemble. Maybe it’s because I’m super close to my sister but I couldn’t get enough of the Natasha/Yelena relationship - from the bickering to the more heartfelt moments. This is my kind of twisted family film.

[:Kevin McCarthy:](https://twitter.com/KevinMcCarthyTV/status/1405555856696086533?s=20)

&gt;I saw [\#BlackWidow](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackWidow?src=hashtag_click)📷 last night &amp; I'm happy to say that it's incredibly fun &amp; deeply emotional. Action feels WINTER SOLDIER level. Pugh, Johansson, Weisz &amp; Harbour are outstanding together. Balances a tone that is dark, grounded, raw &amp; real. Even after ENDGAME, you feel the stakes.  
&gt;  
&gt;There's a certain grittiness this film captures that reminded me of the moment I saw WINTER SOLDIER the first time - my favorite MCU film. The Russo's brought a grounded realism to the action and that's what Cate Shortland has done here. You are reminded Widow is a human being.  
&gt;  
&gt;I missed this type of Marvel storytelling. As much as I enjoy the Disney+ MCU shows, this film reminds you of the scale, scope &amp; production that the MCU movies bring to the table. This is a HUGE film &amp; you can feel it. Incredible end credits scene. Can't wait to see what's next.

marvelstudios,Something that's been nagging me about Loki ep. 1...,[removed],1623958875,o25uco
marvelstudios,The TVA might not be very good at their job,"We know one of the main goals of the TVA is to stop timelines from branching off from what they call the ""sacred timeline"" (which is probably BS imo) and they do this by monitoring the timeline for nexus events, pruning anything that isn't supposed to be there and then reset it back.

We were told in episode 2 the red line is dangerous because once it gets past that point, it's no longer reset-able and can branch off to some crazy multiverse time line. So far it feels like the TVA is implied to have stopped all timelines from reaching this point, and that if they don't it would be disastrous, leading to a big multiversal war. But I think there is actually quite a few timelines that have reached the red line even since the formation of the TVA. Mainly because of these 2 points.

1 - The TVA seem very bad at their job if the other party knows they are coming. These guys don't expect much resistance, and kind of dismiss most people they see, just drop their reset charge and dip. But the Loki Variant has made it clear they are bad at adapting and easily ambushed, even when they know an ambush may be a possibility. To me it seems unlikely they have been able to stop every nexus event out there.

2 - The existence of variants that differ extremely from the ""sacred timeline"" means there are timelines that are nothing like the main timeline at all. Lady Loki, hulky loki, soccer loki aren't just little branches in the timeline. They are extremely different. Seeing how easily and quickly a branch can reach critical levels, without even much visible change, it seems it is very likely these variants are from timelines that are far outside the main timeline.

There are some other possibilities, perhaps these variants are from before the TVA and they are from timestreams that the timekeepers are still cleaning up, or they could be unknown timelines that are somehow off the Radar of the TVA. But in either case, there are surely other timelines out there the TVA aren't controlling, which leads me to believe their whole sacred time line thing is really BS. And nothing ""bad"" will happen from having more multiverses.

Thoughts??",1623958271,o25lq3
marvelstudios,Theory on the nature of TVA Staff.,"&gt;!I don't come up with a lot of theories and generally think they're shit (this goes for mine as well), but this is what I'm thinking right now. These came from a series of comments from a /u/kostispat257 thread you should also check out because it's a good theory. https://redd.it/o24ju8!&lt;

&gt;!I don't think they created everyone. Creating life is a big thing. I think everyone that works at the TVA are probably mind wiped variants, it's a possibility. I think the other analyst the judge talked about is actually Mobius. They probably mind wipe them periodically. It's why they focused on the drink rings. She said they were all from him after he said it was useless to use a coaster because of the rings already there. (don't remember exactly how he phrased it).!&lt;

&gt;!Maybe after a while they start to remember where/when they came from and they re-mind wipe them. Maybe thats what Lady Loki /Enchantress or whatever did to that Minuteman girl, showed her the truth.!&lt;

&gt;!Or maybe they just do it for security purposes.!&lt;


&gt;!In the comics there is more than one Mobius, so it's also possible they use multiple variants.!&lt;

&gt;!And lastly, This is random. But they had all those exampl of variant Loki's, maybe this isn't the first Loki they've tried to use as ""help"" on a mission (or even with this mission, because wibbly wobbly time shit) and that's maybe one reason why Ravonna was so adamant it wouldn't work.!&lt;

&gt;!And with the mind wipes of course Mobius wouldn't remember those missions or whatever.!&lt;",1623957962,o25h8s

marvelstudios,[LOKI SPOILER] Timekeepers are the creators of life,"The TVA’s mascot, Miss Minutes is a clock, a human invention.

marvelstudios,How does the First Doctor Strange Fit Into Loki?,"So something that's been bugging me is the fact that the original Doctor Strange sort of establishes that a multiverse exists.

I bring it up because that always kind of confused me. I guess it’s just weird to refer to an area and population of a medium sized American city as a whole planet. From a world building point of view it comes off a little lazy but definitely makes it easier for story telling. You don’t have to be concerned with the complexities and nuance of different competing civilizations. Asgard is just one super homogenous people and city. I’ve never read the comics so it this totally off base?",1623956553,o24x3o
marvelstudios,[LOKI SPOILERS] Who do you think Ravonna was talking about?,"There was this very sus conversation between Mobius and Ravonna in episode 2. Mobius kinda questioned the existence of the Time-keepers, because he's been spending too much time with Loki. But then Mobius comments about how some of the souvenirs in Ravonna's office, like the pen, are not from his own missions, to which Ravonna responds that she has another analyst working for her.

Mobius looked kinda in disbelief and I think the scene lingered a bit too much on that beat, so I think Ravonna is hiding something and her other analyst is someone that Mobius shouldn't know about. 

Ravonna (and probably other judges too) also seems to be the only one who has a one-on-one with the timekeepers, so if someone knows the truth about all this, it's here. She's definitely hiding something.

And of course, since Ravonna is Kang's love interest in the comics and there has been much speculation and rumours about Kang making his first appearance in the series before Quantumania, I think that he is both the Timekeepers and Ravonna's supposed secret ""analyst"".

My theory is that he created the TVA and its workers to preserve the timeline that he lives in and to allow the existence of only the branches that he creates (and rules over). The Timekeepers and Multiversal War things are just some fake scenarios that he came up with (while also serving as Easter Eggs to the Timekeepers and the Secret Wars from the comics universe) to use as propaganda to keep the TVA workers working.

And Ravonna is, for some reason, covering for him. 

Or maybe, as Loki said, they will go with the ""expected"" (the TVA and Ravonna are telling the truth), because when people know you are a trickster (like Marvel Studios), they expect from you, the unexpected, making the ""expected"" the most unexpected scenario. 

The show drops so many hints and has done a good job at paralelling Loki and the TVA with many lines in just 2 episodes, so I really don't know what to expect anymore lmao

marvelstudios,"Here's the thing. You said ""duplication casting is illusion projection.""","Here's the thing. You said ""duplication casting is illusion projection.""

Is it in the same school of magic? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is the god of mischief who studies magic, I am telling you, specifically, in magic, no one calls duplication casting illusion projection. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""illusion magic"" you're referring to the arcane grouping of misdirection magic, which includes things from mirror images to invisibility to hallucination. 

So your reasoning for calling duplication casting illusion projection is because random people ""call deceptions illusions?"" Let's get sleight of hand and mirages in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone real or a variant? It's not one of the other, that's not how the multiverse works. They're both. Duplication casting is duplication casting and a member of the illusion school of magic. But that's not what you said. You said duplication casting is illusion projection, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all misdirection magic illusions, which means you'd call mirages, hallucination, and invisibility illusions too. Which you said you don't.

marvelstudios,I’m pretty sure there are multiple TVAs,"I think each reality has its own TVA that believes their reality is the ‘sacred timeline.’ Their job isn’t to protect one timeline, it’s to keep them all separate. There probably aren’t even any Timekeepers, at least not active ones. The TVA workers are just told that there are so they don’t question what they’re doing.

I also think this explains the coffee rings in the director lady’s office. They were left there by another Mobius from a different timeline-reality; likely only who has her job in his reality (so that our Mubius can discover that he is, in fact, a measurably ‘inferior’ version of himself). The heads of each TVA probably talk to each other regularly, but in secret, to make sure nobody finds out about the others.",1623953864,o23ue2

marvelstudios,"Ok, here’s my thoughts about Loki","I think the show itself is compelling and well made, but the implications to the grander MCU are sketchy. 

A. The quality of the show is pretty good! Loki has a pretty compelling character arc, and him seeing the timeline of his own life was a pretty interesting idea. The soundtrack is AWESOME, the dialogue is good, and seeing Owen Wilson play Owen Wilson is always a good time. I don’t think some of the supporting acting is the best, as we’ve seen in some other marvel TV shows, but the lead acting is phenomenal. That being said, I do think there’s a few ideological problems the show brings up...

B. The TVA does seem a bit choosy with what they control. Particularly thanos, who we’ve seen alter time on multiple occasions for his own benefit. The idea that it was all ‘supposed’ to happen sounds like marvel’s way of covering up potential plot holes, and it makes the stakes of the mcu feel lower. Rather than the sacrifices and decisions of our heroes feeling difficult and tragic, they now feel like just a construct of the TVA. Going back and watching falcon and the winter soldier right now isn’t nearly as compelling knowing there’s this all powerful time entity working it all behind the curtain. The TVA concept as a whole feels a little too small-town police station for what this means for the mcu as a whole, because nothing that happened before this show really has any significance at all now. Second, I really wish the Loki they’re chasing was also Tom hiddleston. For SOME REASON they changed her, but man it would’ve been cool to see two Tom hiddleston Loki’s, each in different points of their lives, have a conversation with each other. Lastly, I think 70’s and 80’s rock is a bit overused now. It worked for iron man and Star lord, but I think marvel should draw back on how often they put it into random fight scenes. It kind of took me out of this world, especially with the awesome soundtrack this show already has. That ALL being said, i enjoyed the first two episodes! What do you guys think?

marvelstudios,My predictions for the end of the series.,"So as we all know last night's episode of Loki ended with not only the revelation of that it's been Lady Loki all Along. But also had Loki leave with her as the the sacred timeline began to break apart.

Personally I loved this, not only was it a great subversion of expectations as we were led to believe this would be a buddy cop show when in reality it wasn't, but also I think it's going to make things a lot more interesting down the road, and personally, I cant wait to finally see the true multiverse. And yes, I believe for the rest of the episodes we will see other alternative realities as seen in the trailer (which includes the Vote Loki universe) but also I believe the TVA are the true main villains of the series, and that it will end with them failing to stop the Multiverse from returning, which I believe will lead directly into No Way Home (if rumors are true) and Multiverse of Madness, and yes I believe Loki will have a role to play in Multiverse of Madness.

However, it is also possible loki could be doing an inside job and try to stop Lady Loki at the last minute, but ultimately if that is the case I think he will fail, and I believe at the end the multiverse will return, however I also believe Wanda will tear through it causing it to go ""Mad"", with Strange having to step in and fix it and restore the Multiverse, not the Sacred Timeline, but the Multiverse as I Believe the Multiverse will remain for good, as well as having a run in with Wanda and Loki of course. Though I do hope this doesn't mean Mobius will be a secret bad guy, maybe Mobius convinces Loki not to go through with his plans, or maybe he realizes the TVA are corrupt and let's Loki destroy them, who knows.",1623949472,o224gx

marvelstudios,"Some wild-ass speculation about ""Loki"" (spoilers through episode 02)","Ep 2 ends with the introduction of a character that may or may not be ""Lady Loki"", but we are definitely meant to believe is the villain of the series. BUT, in ep 1, when Mobius is at the French chapel and asks the kid ""Who did this?"" The kid points at a stained glass image of a decidedly masculine looking devil figure.

Because of the timing of her introduction - at the end of Loki's conversation with a series of people possessed by the bad guy - we're meant to think that this Lady Loki is the one who possessed those people, kidnapped that TVA agent, etc. But there really is no direct evidence of that. All we really know is that a shadowy figure who has a similar hoodie did those things.

Based on the image the kid pointed out and at what seems like an attempt at misdirection, I'm guessing that ""Lady Loki"" (or Enchantress, or whoever) is a rogue good guy, not the main antagonist.

Also, base on the amount of mentions of Loki being ""a scared little boy"", I'm betting that before this series is over, Loki will loop back into Mobius's own past, shapeshift into the kid in the French chapel (a ""scared little boy"") and give Mobius a tip that will come in handy in the ultimate unraveling the mystery of the real villain.",1623948857,o21vod

marvelstudios,What if Thanos was supposed to win?,"So time moves differently in the TVA. What if all of this show takes place before the final Endgame battle?

Thanos promised to rebuild the entire universe from scratch so that it would not know what it had lost, only what it had been given. It is possible that this could be beneficial to the TVA, b/c a ""happy universe"" with full bellies and warm hearts may be more stable and less prone to variants.

We already know through Ragnorak and Infinity War that Loki is capable of *some* good. And he also wants control of the TVA, as he states that it is truly the greatest power in the universe. So if he were to double cross the TVA, and either take it over, or destroy it altogether, he could actually influence the final endgame battle. With 14,000,604 versions where they lose, perhaps they weren't supposed to win. The one outcome of them winning is without the TVA being able to stop them. 

This addresses a few things. (1) Variant Gamora is allowed to exist in the sacred timeline, (2) Steve Rogers is allowed to live out a full life in a variant timeline with a variant Peggy, (3) it opens up the multiverse for Dr. Strange, Peter Parker, and Scott Lang, (4) it gives Loki the last laugh against Thanos, and (5) he finally gets to feel what ultimate power is like.",1623945101,o20gx9
marvelstudios,Something Mobius said that strongly hints that he will...,"betray the time keepers. Or at least go against their strictest dictates.

""Sometimes you get tired of playing the same part. Is that possible?""

He is referring to Loki, of course. But it sounds like he is also referring to himself. He's a bit of a renegade in the TVA. The biggest example of this is him recruiting a variant to help them. But that isn't the only example. He also jokes about destroying the TVA and even has aspirations outside of it seemingly unlike the other members, ie jet skiing.

So, setting up Lady Loki not playing the part of a villain because she is tired of that role? Probable. A callback to Sacred Loki turning into a hero? Sure. Foreshadowing Mobius turning against the TVA in some way? Is that possible?

At the very least he could go ahead and jet ski right before a total apocalypse and it wouldn't go against the dictates of the timeline because the apocalypse will destroy everything and it wouldn't matter what he does.

marvelstudios,"About the Apocalypse Classification. Lot of people r getting confused about it. So, I've made a detailed file","I have seen a lot of people getting confused about how a&gt;! town's destruction !&lt;getting classified higher than a &gt;!planet getting destroyed!&lt;. So, I have made a detailed file.

**The Apocalypse Classes**

class 0: total destruction of everything (where not just our Universe, and not just The Multiverse, but the totality of The 'Verses', containing all alternate dimensions, planes of existence(quantum realm, null-time zone, etc), timelines, alternate continuities, realities cease to exist)

1. class 1: Multiversal Scale destruction (all timelines get destroyed, but eg null time zone intact)
2. class 2: Universal Scale destruction
3. class 3: Galactic-scale destruction
4. class 4: total planetary system destruction
5. class 5: star destruction
6. class 6: total planetary destruction, Total Extinction ^(class 6.1 planetary body intact, Total Extinction of species)
7. class 7: total planetary destruction, Entire civilization Annihilated
8. class 8: large meteorite fall/similar event(\~10,000,000,000 km sq Annihilated)
9. class 9: major tectonic plate destruction(\~67,800,000 km sq Annihilated)
10. class 10: planetary body intact, entire town Annihilated (\~50,000km sq Annihilated)
11. class 11: minor meteorite fall/similar event Annihilated(\~10,000 km sq Annihilated)
12. .......and probably goes on till 30 to classify all ""apocalypses""

*\[there are sub-classes for each class \]*

Only explained 1st 2 classes; rest are pretty self explanatory

**Examples**

&gt;!Lady Loki just caused a subtype of class 1, putting the multiverse into chaos but not Annihilating it completely(yet)!&lt;

~~Thanos throwing a moon on titan(well tony rly) would be a subclass of class 9 Apocalypse kinda~~

If Ultron would have succeeded with his plan it would be a class 6.1/ 6a Apocalypse

&gt;!The Westview anomaly would be a subclass of class 10!&lt;

\[Strikethrough because they cause more confusion than clarification\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Also:**

67,800,000 km sq is he size of the Eurasian Plate;

50k km sq is the size of Alabama state

I typed it myself, used class 10: planetary body intact, entire town Annihilated for the&gt;! 2050 roxxcart apocalypse!&lt; and class 7: total planetary destruction, Entire civilization Annihilated for&gt;! ragnarok as references !&lt; to classify all the other classes

The TVA says there is only the Sacred Timeline, and some potential new timelines created by Variants, which the TVA already destroys before they can became alternative timelines. But the multiverse isn't just alternative universes and earths. 

The Ancient One mentions the Multiverse in Doctor Strange. We already know that other realms and dimensions exists, like the Quantum Realm, the Dark Dimension, the Mirror Dimension, and maybe the Chaos Dimension?. 

So doesn't that mean the Multiverse exists? Or when the TVA talks about the Multiverse, do they only include infinite number of parallel universes, not the Dark Dimension and such? Like a Multiverse of different dimensions, sources and realms already exists, but a Multiverse of parallel universes and alternative timelines doesn't exists yet.

marvelstudios,LOKI + MCU Multiverse Situation - What are the facts?,"There seems to be a great amount of confusion regarding the state of the MCU, the Multiverse, and other timelines.

Some people think that the Sacred Timeline is the only timeline, and all other branch timelines are pruned. This makes sense with the visual depictions we see in LOKI but does not add up with the rest of the MCU we've seen so far.

Dr. Strange is able to see the possible futures of their encounter with Thanos. So we can assume that's just possible branches in the main Sacred Timeline. The Avengers were supposed to travel back in time and defeat Thanos so the Loki variant we follow gets pruned by design in order to maintain the sacred timeline. This all creates the notion that there is ONE timeline and the TVA works to maintain it diligently.

Except that's not possible.

We SEE that there are other timelines already with Lady Loki, and the other Loki Variants. These aren't just variants that were late to work, or stepped off their planned path. These are entirely different Loki's in gender, apperance and abilities.

These are other timelines that are allowed to exist outside of the Sacred Timeline. Most likely these timelines can exist because they do not pose a threat of redlining into a Nexus event.

Now where the TVA comes in is when a Nexus event occurs. This causes a multiverse event that goes beyond just a timeline with many possibilities, a multiverse has infinite possibilities and therefore cannot be contained or controlled.

If I got anything wrong please correct me, but so far I see LOKI giving us a distinction between a different timeline and a different universe.",1623937218,o1xic8

marvelstudios,A theory regarding Loki and Endgame time travel,"In episode 2 of Loki, it's established that the reset charges don't reset an entire timeline, they just reset everything within a certain radius.

So, the 2012 timeline wasn't reset completely when Loki was captured by the TVA. Loki was removed after he had gotten the tesseract and landed in Mongolia. This didn't affect anything in New York. They never reset him *getting* the tesseract, just him *having* it afterwards.

This implies that everything else that resulted from Loki getting the tesseract, such as Steve and Tony traveling back to 1970, was supposed to happen as the TVA didn't stop it.

But here's the problem: If Loki had never gotten the tesseract, the Avengers could have just taken it back to 2023 without having to travel back further. The 1970 timeline would be unnecessary because the same end goal is still achieved, and logically, TVA policy should be to have as few timeline branches as possible (that's their whole thing). So, leaving the 1970 branch in place makes no sense.

Unless...

Tony and Steve traveling further back was supposed to happen because they created a branch in the 70s by stealing the tesseract and Pym particles and creating a Nexus event. This branch could have later redlined and resulted in the first multiversal war and, by extension, the creation of the TVA. 

This would explain why the TVA has a 70s aesthetic.

TL;DR:
* Loki takes tesseract
* Steve and Tony travel back to 1970
* 1970 branch timeline redlines
* Multiversal war
* TVA is formed with 70s aesthetic
* TVA leaves branch alone to maintain its own existence",1623935209,o1wsy1
marvelstudios,Loki Time Travel Theory,"I have a theory that every year/date that the TVA/Loki(s) have travelled/will travel to has some sort of MCU, historical, or time travel significance. This is due to the following circumstances within the *Loki* series so far:

First Episode:
- 2012 AD (beginning of episode 1): Date of the Battle of New York, and the date that the Avengers time travelled to for the space/mind stone (proper flow of time)
- 1549 AD (Mobius’ incident analysis): Known as “The Year of the Many-Headed Monster” in the Kingdom of England, and ""many-headed monster"" could describe Loki with his shape-shifting capabilities
- 1858 AD (Lady Loki's attack on TVA): Abraham Lincoln famously says ""A house divided against itself cannot stand"", possibly describing the TVA's current/eventual division, or the division of timelines, and how this division could cause mass destruction

Second Episode:
- 1985 AD (another Lady Loki attack on TVA): year that *Back to the Future* was released/took place, possible reference to time travel, and to the importance of the proper flow of time/stability of the space-time continuum.
- 79 AD (Loki/Mobius theory testing): The destruction of Pompeii (obviously), but also a precedent was set for the TVA based on Loki's theory that anything that happens before chaos does not affect the proper flow of time. It is assumed that this is a precedent, since Mobius had no idea that Loki's theory was true.
- 2050 AD (reveal of Lady Loki and her headquarters): Lady Loki sends the reset charges to multiple MCU-significant locations/times, breaking the proper flow of time, and possibly causing a multiversal war. If this caused a multiversal war, it might be related to the events of future movies (*Spider-Man: No Way Home*, *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*, etc.)

These years/dates might be just coincidental, but I think that Marvel chose them for the reasons I described. Let me know how you feel about this theory.",1623934982,o1wq9t

Especially since Loki's gender was listed as fluid on his profile, and gender fluid doesn't mean two different people with two different genders, it means one person who sometimes presents as male, sometimes presents as female, so I think it would've made more sense and been more impactful if female Loki was played by Tom himself, and Disney+ isn't even available in China (yet?) so I don't know why they didn't go that route. I also really don't like the actress playing female Loki, not just because she took my dream of an ACTUAL gender fluid Marvel character away from me, but she just didn't ""wow"" or ""overwhelm"" me with her reveal, it felt anti-climatic, and I also hate that she's blonde.

marvelstudios,(Spoilers) Loki: The TVA is brainwashed and lying about the sacred timeline.,"SPOILERS




This whole thing was not thought out and thus it reads like a rant. I apologise. But enjoy.

In Loki Episode 2 Loki explained that the variant must be hiding in an apocolyptic event because no matter what's going to happen the timeline will not change due to the same ending. This was proven. I will be using this as a basis to explain my theory. Ok brace yourself this is about to get whacky. If apocolyptic events cancel out what happens before them (I know that the proven event happened just before the disaster but just stick with me). The universe has to end eventually and with it the sacred timeline. But the universe ending as the final apocolyptic event for everything. No matter how it happens it is final. Nothingness is final. With this nothing matters because it must all end the same. This means that the stated purpose of keeping the universe from collapsing must be false because even if the universe collapsed and ended that would stick to the sacred timeline. So what about the purpose of keeping the separate timelines from going to war. This would assume that the TVA actually cares about life which they have shown to be willing to dispense of without a second thought. Besides with the power to cull an entire timeline it seems silly that they couldn't just take down the people causing the war to happen. Unless. Its not because they care about the life that's supposed to exist. It's because if another timeline appears That timeline must have its own TVA. So my theory is that the TVA has to protect THEIR sacred timeline and not ""The"" Sacred timeline. The TVA is immensely powerful. I also am going to state that after the TVA's conquered their own respective timelimes they caused that original Multiversal war. So in short the TVA is only concerned with keeping their own power over all of time. Any another TVA would pose a threat to themselves. Their members are most likely brainwashed as a result of the leaders of the TVA the timekeepers needing to keep their power and they can't have overly sympathetic TVA personal. This also makes sense due to the fact that only humans inhabit the TVA. See in the Multiverse different species founded their timelines TVA and in the end the human one must have won the war. Or did only one universe survive? See Below.

Now then, this is where it gets interesting because I believe the above theory can exist on its own but this will be an addition that works with it but can be disregarded if you think it's too much. Now I will go on to explain why there are already separate timeline and thus universes which create the Multiverse. And who is the true leader of the TVA. Okay so I'm going to hop right in brace yourself once more. The true leader of the TVA and of the Supposed three timekeepers is Kang the Conquerer. Now hold on before you click off. Hear me out. It's already been stated that one of the timekeepers looks like Kang the Conquerer. I'm hear to state that one of the timekeepers is actually Kang but he's not a timekeeper so much as a time conquerer who wants to keep his domain in check. So I believe that after the Multiversal war Kang was one of the main leaders of an army or of the more powerful TVA. He declared himself the king of time after winning the war. His queen became one of the other time conquerer's. The third may be his child or a general it doesn't really matter either way because Kang is the real leader instead of it being a Triarchy. Ok so my Kang TVA theory states that apart from not letting other TVA's exist as to not threaten the TVA and this Kang. Kang also doesn't want to have to conquer more universes than he has to. The stated mission of the TVA behind All of the lies is Order. Kang wants order over the multiverses and their timelines. Now I've already stated that another Universe can't be created by splitting the timeline because of the fact that the timeline has to end the same in every universe no matter what. So basically there can be multiple timelines in one universe but they can't form their own branch universe no matter what. Also as a side note I think that the TVA is in the Quantum Realm because of its timelessness and because Kang is supposed to appear in Ant Man 3. Anyway, the main purpose of the TVA is stop other timelines from existing so that there cannot be any chance that the other timelines TVA alerts the other TVA's which would cause a rebellion against Kang. Kang basically uses the TVA as the secret police to control his conquered Universes. Once again to maintain order at the cost of liberty. I also think Kangs wife is dead so there is only one timekeeper left. Himself.
Kang also might just rule that timeline and TVA is secret police, ect. Who knows.

Side theory, the other timekeeper that I didn't mention could be Dormamu who rebelled against Kang. He is devoted to Chaos and is conquering the Multiverse which Kang must stop. Also just saying that in order to stop Dormamu they used the TIME stone.

So that's it. That's the theory. I hope you enjoyed weather you believe it or if you think it's crazy and too much.

TLDR: TVA is keeping the Universe in check so that other timelines TVA's don't take over. Kang also might be ruling the timeline and the Multiverse and Waring with Dormamu. Yes it is insane I know.",1623929723,o1v3vo

Variant is actually from one of the countless realities destroyed by the Time Keepers in order to establish the Sacred Timeline. She was able to escape and has been trying to use TVA tech to undo it.

Unfortunately, the tech won't go back to before the Sacred Timeline was established. The closest she can get is the last moments of the apocalypse. Which she can only view from afar at the dawn of the Sacred Timeline.

marvelstudios,Explaining “Change” in the sacred timeline,"Ravonna when discussing Loki’s ability to change says it can’t happen “unless the time keepers decree it”. This statement has interesting implications for how variants and the sacred timelime work. Lets examine how Loki has so many weird variants that are even allowed to exist to begin with.

For example how did Loki win the Tour de France? We saw Loki get arrested by the Minute men the moment he escaped the avengers, yet he somehow managed to win the Tour de France before anyone caught him. What about female Loki? When did she become a variant? When she was born or became female? Well then how did the TVA not grab her the moment she was born or transitioned? 

This is what I’m going to explain.

Lets take the Blue Loki and this hypothetical scenario. In version 2.0.2 of the Sacred timeline, the time keepers saw Loki learn he was from Jotenheim and this time decide to become an ice giant fully instead of betraying Laufey, his father. Then the time keepers let that timeline go and on and on until something “very bad” happened like 3000 years later stemming from Loki in 2008 deciding to side with Laufey. So then the time keepers scrap the entire 2.0.2 version of the timeline and start 2.0.3 where Loki sides with Odin and rejects his ice giant form. Loki has therefore “Changed” when the time keepers “decreed it”. This then becomes the new Sacred timeline which all deviations from are now considered “variants” including Blue ice giant Loki. 

Basically its an iterative process, like trial and error. The time keepers dont just magically know what is the best timeline. Mobius says that if the time keepers were to discover the perfect flow of time, there would automatically no longer exist Nexus events. Therefore this hasnt happened yet. Even the events of the current MCU are up for “Change” in case they themselves are hindering something like 10000 years in the future from being what the Time keepers deem as good.

The problem remains its up to the time keepers to decide what is a good and bad outcome for everything at the end of time, and why should they decide that? But for now this is the explanation for how “change” can even occur in this kind of fatalistic universe. The time keepers keep on redoing the entire universe essentially and killing off the previous “sacred timeline” and thats how you can find a female Loki who is born or becomes female and lives a very long time as female before one day being deemed a variant because the timeline of her existence is no longer considered the Sacred timeline anymore.",1623928323,o1uppk
marvelstudios,Loki Series Prediction (episode 2 spoilers),"After episode 2 ending, when the timeline gets bombed, I rewatched all the Loki trailers again and came up with a theory. Pls let me know your thoughts:

So the timeline gets bombed, and all branches reach red line due to which Mobius says in the trailers a lot of times ‘you put our timeline in chaos and we want you to help us fix it’
Due to this multiple realities open up where in one reality Loki becomes president, in the other New York of 2012 gets nuked etc.

Every scene of the trailer where the background seems purplish, it’s the place where ‘randy’ and Loki go.

And that place is where the timekeepers are.",1623928264,o1up53

marvelstudios,"What is a Multiverse and why the MCU is in its own Multiverse, seperate from the comics or the non-MCU Marvel movies"," From the Marvel wiki ([Source 1](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse), [Source 2](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Omniverse))

&gt;The **Multiverse** is the collection of alternate universes which share a similar nature and universal hierarchy; it is a subsection of the larger **Omniverse**, the collection of all alternate universes (not only the Marvel ones, but every single literary, television show, movie, urban legend, universe, realm, etc. ever including our own world). **A large variety of these universes (those that constitute a Multiverse) originated as forms of divergence from other realities, where an event with different possible outcomes gives rise to different universes, one for each outcome.** Some can seem to be taking place in the past or future due to differences in how time passes in each universe. Often, new universes and dimensions are born due to time traveling.  
&gt;  
&gt;A **Universe/Continuity** is a single reality, such as Earth-616, the mainstream Marvel Universe/Continuity. In Marvel Comics, the concept of a continuity is not the same as ""dimension"" or ""galaxy""; for example, characters like Mephisto and Dormammu hail from alternate dimensions and the Celestials from another galaxy, but they all nevertheless belong to Universe-616.

In other words, a universe/continuity starts out as a single timestream (which was born out of the big bang). If the timestream branches off into a different, parallel timestream, that new timestream is called *“alternate timeline”, “branch”, “branched timeline”, “branched universe”* or *“alternate universe”*. **A single timestream and all of its branches constitute a “Multiverse”**, while all the different Multiverses constitute a “Megaverse”.  

The **Megaverse** is a structure present between Multiverse and Omniverse which links multiverses more closely associated to one another.

The MCU (Earth-199999) seems to be part part of the greater Marvel Megaverse, but it seems to be part of a different multiverse than the one Earth-616 is part of, since the 616 timestream allows branches to be created, while the 199999 timestream doesn’t, because of the rules set by the Timekeepers. Also, if those 2 were part of the same Multiverse, one of them would have to be a branch of the other, which is again prohibited by the Timekeepers.

Similarly, the Raimiverse, Webbverse, Foxverse etc are most likely different multiverses (timestreams with all of their possible branches) than the MCU and comics Multiverses.",1623926723,o1u9sl
marvelstudios,Did the logo really glitch?,"I’ve seen the videos for the Spanish version of the Spider-Man logo, and I’m not entirely convinced it’s a callback to Into the Spiderverse.

But at the same time it doesn’t seem exactly what everyone thinks it is.

marvelstudios,Why did the variant...,"# Spoilers for episode 2 of Loki.

&amp;#x200B;

... use reset charges?

**tl;dr** Too much time spent wondering how reset charges work, and why detonating reset charges on the sacred timeline (no variance energy) would create variant branches (more variance energy), when they're specifically described as tools that do the opposite. If this has been answered elsewhere a link would be appreciated!

Loki quotes from the TVA training material that the purpose of reset charges is to ""prune the effected radius of the branched timeline, allowing time to heal all its wounds,"" and then adds his own explanation, ""Which, by the way, sounds like it disintegrates everything in its vicinity"". So how does it actually work? Does it selectively destroy variant energy/material to heal the timeline, or does it simply ""destroy everything in its vicinity""? In the medieval festival, after the reset charge detonates, the only material we see disintegrating is the TVA material, not everything around it, which suggests that reset charges only disintegrate variant material, and not as Loki jokes/suggests, ""everything in its vicinity"". But maybe it was just a misleading depiction of the charge's effect, and everything in the branch is being disintegrated. If everything in the variant branch is disintegrated going back in time until reaching the sacred timeline, the reset charge must know when to stop disintegrating or else it will disturb the sacred timeline. Reset charges must be able to somehow recognize not to disintegrate parts of the sacred timeline (little to zero variance energy) and to disintegrate variant branches (above some threshold amount of variance energy) in order to restore the sacred timeline. If reset charges naturally create variant branches in the process of restoring the sacred timeline, they would be completely self-defeating as tools used by the TVA. tl;dr Reset charges reduce variance energy in order to reset the sacred timeline.

Given that understanding of reset charges, the effect of detonating a reset charge on the sacred timeline should be nothing. The variance energy on the sacred timeline is already where it should be at, there's nothing to restore or disintegrate. And yet, variant branches are detected by the TVA at the end of the episode. The easiest explanation is that female Loki tampered with the reset charges, making them more like conventional bombs that ""disintegrate everything in its vicinity"". But if that were the case, couldn't she have used any bomb, or any disturbance of the timeline to achieve a similar effect? The real weapon female Loki seems to possess is the ability to send things through time, which she presumably has had prior to trapping and killing the TVA squads in various points in time. Something should be unique about specifically using the reset charges in order to justify the time used and risk taken by female Loki in ambushing numerous TVA squads. Perhaps the branches that reset charges create are unique in some way, harder to reset? Fake variant branch readings designed to lure the TVA away? Maybe they're just super-duper big A-bombs? Specifically effective in killing the Time-Keepers? My favorite tinfoil so far is that female Loki reversed the reset charges, making them disintegrate low variance energy things instead of high, meaning the sacred timeline is now like a fuse lit up at multiple points along its length. tl;dr Female Loki is going Lady and the Tramp and Lady and the Tramp on the sacred timeline.

It's odd to me that they spent so much time explaining how reset charges work, and, to me, seemingly renege on that at the end of the episode. I imagine the TVA material did not tell the whole truth about how reset charges work, but without tampering from female Loki, I just don't see how a tool specifically used to patch up the sacred timeline would create branches. Weird writing or hinting at something in future episodes? Or most likely I didn't hear something and am missing completely obvious. Thoughts?",1623925182,o1tv2o

marvelstudios,Why TVA allowed 2014 timeline Thanos to travel to the future in Endgame?,"In Endgame, the Avengers while traveling back in time created three major alternate timelines.

2012 timeline : Cap tells Hydra agents that he's one of them and his 2012 self that Bucky is alive. 

But only Loki taking the Tesseract made him a Variant according to the TVA. When Cap would've already created a variant timeline by sharing future knowledge with Hydra agents and his 2012 self.

Anyway, TVA did arrive to reset the timeline so it doesn't matter.

1946 timeline : Cap again creates an alternate timeline by going back in time to live the rest of his life with Peggy. This can be explained through that he never actually changed anything, but created a never ending loop.

The Old Cap that we saw at the end of Endgame wasn't the same who just went through the portal to return the stones. He was the one who already completed his journey. 

Like in the last episode of Loki, the acopylypse theory proved that ""sacred timeline"" doesn't mean only ONE SINGLE timeline. Multiple timelines can exist as long as they mirror each other and nothing major changes.

So as long as Cap never told anyone that he's alive, changed his identity, he never created a variant timeline. 

2014 timeline : Thanos catches the future Nebula, reverse engineers the Pym particles to travel into the future to fight the Avengers. 

Why TVA didn't stop Thanos as soon as he caught future Nebula and created a Variant timeline? 

They would've had to reset the timeline anyway as 2014 Thanos, his army and Gamora would've disappeared because they never returned back to their timeline, making it a Variant timeline.

TVA allowing Thanos to travel to the future only resulted in us audience get an awesome battle in Endgame and Tony ending up dying.

The only explanation is it was ""supposed to happen"", which is a lazy explanation and Marvel shouldn't rely too much on it.

So Tony was ""supposed to die"" according to the Timekeepers? Why? That doesn't make any sense.

Is 2014 Gamora also a Variant? She was supposed to die at the hands of Thanos at Vormir. But because of time travel shenanigans, she never met the Guardians or had any growth.

Why TVA didn't catch her? Or have they and we would see it in GOTG Vol 3?",1623914857,o1rbs8

marvelstudios,Should the TVA be waiting until the last moment before 'redline' to reset the timeline?,"We've been shown that the 'redline' is the breaking point where a timeline becomes an alternate timeline. E.g.: you don't set your alarm and become a variant as you are late for work and by skipping coffee and missing the morning briefing you mess up causing the apocalypse. 

In this scenario, the TVA arrest you immediately as you leave your house and reset the timeline.

But why?

You haven't redlined yet! They should give you the chance to rejoin the timeline. They have their tech which will read the proximity to the redline. At any point up to red, that could start to swing back. Maybe you get to work late, miss the briefing, and your colleague hands you a coffee to get you going and tells you about the warning in the briefing. Apocalypse averted. 

In ep.2 we have a TVA agent freaking out because the redline is approaching. So we know they don't give the timeline the maximum time to correct itself.

I'd like to know what you think of this? Also, why you think this is?

Perhaps variants are more likely to create more variants? Like if I'm already a variant does that affect more people so one branch splits into three and it gets too much to manage?

Or maybe they only enter once it passes what they've deemed to be the 'cut off' for whether or not it's likely to swing back?

I did not get disappointed for mephisto not showing up, to be honest i did  except Doctor Strange to show up , put come on not even saying his name, he appeared in endgame, he was mentioned by name FFH and him TFAWS, but the project whose protagonist co-stars in Doctor strange show, just says sorcerer supreme, and not even as reference to Strange specifically but as sorcerer supremes in general (Strange isn't even sorcerer supreme yet)

And the show (especially the ads) made it seem like there is something dark and creepy hiding behind all of this, the microwave ticking, wanda ordering vision, that scary-ass beekeeper (who btw we never find out what happened to him) it felt there was going to be something truly horrifying behind it, but then, nothing, plot twists you can see from a mile away

And also, here is something that angered me on a more personal level, i am a fan of speedsters, flash, reverse-flash, quicksilver, you name it, since arrowverse sucks now, the flash movie has been in development for years but the DCEU seems to be going down and apparently reverse flash isn't going to be the villain in it, and trailer hasn't dropped yet, i am not really that hyped for it, and x-men ended horribly, so when quicksilver appeared, played by even peters, i thought that maybe there is hope, maybe instead of both quicksilvers being gone forever, they both returned, and also, maybe this isn't the end of the fox universe, or for that matter, any of the other marvel universes, maybe this opens a way to the spider-verse, mayb- BOOOHNERRRRRR, they took my hopes and dreams, and turned them into a boner joke, i hated that, i truly hated it

and also the suit, to this day, i enjoy just looking at Anthony mackie in his captain america suit, it just looks good,but wanda's suit, nah not really, and agatha didn't really look good

And the crew teasing stuff

""The show has more cgi budget than endgame"" ok then, where is it, the cgi was not marvel's best, they are really good at aging (Peggy and steve) and de-aging (nick fury and hank pym), but when agatha made wanda age with her powers, it just looked bad

""There is a Luke Skywalker level character appearance in the show"" WELL WHERE IS IT?

and the ending with wanda, vision and thier kids, ok i have to admit, it was emotional, but the dialogue was Crap, people don't talk like Shakespeare when they are emotional, it was just written badly

And they kept trying to insert monica and turning into spectrum into the story even though it completely unrelated

But i have to admit, the show did some good stuff, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany acting was awesome, the show manged to get me hyped very well (it just didn't live up to that hype)

marvelstudios,The first Multiverse War involved EVERYONE,"# TL;DR - Mojoverse was a 'pocket battle' in the first Multiversal War and the X-Men escapes the war and joins the MCU in Phase 7 onwards.

\-----------  

First of all, forgive the title but the first multiverse war might've involved everyone in the Marvel Comics, mainly X-Men and Fantastic 4. To branch off (hehe) on that idea, what's happening in Loki is that we are in the middle part of the next multiversal war.

I might be reaching on this part but with the No Way Home speculations that will make all Spider-Man films canon, would it be a reach to make the X-verse be canon as well. Explanation's below:

* On the Disney+ site, I think it's labeled as Marvel's Legacy for the FoX-Men movies. Keep it that way till Phase 7, or *the reveal* that it's all included.
* Once Phase 7 kicks off, rename Marvel's Legacy as Mojoverse making it a meta retcon since all the FoX-Men movies negate any kind of timeline and were produced for the entertainment of a certain race.
* Produce a trilogy that shows younger X-Men members figuring out what happened to them ( was stoked when the New Mutants was reshot but alas, it's not connected to the MCU) and are gathering other X-people throughout the pocket Mojoverse. With this route we can still get cameos from the OG actors letting go of their character as they fight in the Mojoworld as the younger cast and Variant characters leave to join the MCU. Example: Ian McKellen dies saving in the ensuing Mojo-war, a pocket battle in the grand Multiversal war, and Michael Fassbender is now Variant Magneto
* After escaping, they are now granted as the canonical versions of the character and we can go on from there.",1623909554,o1pyn8
marvelstudios,Loki Episode 2 finally confirmed the big question we've had about time travel: What creates a branch?,"This was a big topic of discussion. Obviously we learned in the first episode that a branch is created when someone goes against his pre-determined life path as set by the timekeepers, but what time travelers? When someone time travels, does the action of time travelling by itself create an alternate timeline or do you have to make changes that were not meant to happen in order to create a branch?

The way **Professor Hulk** explains it, it is left vague. Sure you can't ""change"" the future by travelling to the past, but can you stay in the past without changing the future and then come back to the present of your own timeline having lived in a loop? Cause if yes, then **that's what Cap did**.

**Deke** from Agents of SHIELD offered this exact theory in Season 7 Episode 1 of the show. 

&gt;*Imagine time as a stream, right? And we \[the time travellers\] were sticks that were thrown into it. The water, it… it moves us... it moves around us. But it ends up in the same place.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Right. Now, too many sticks thrown in and that will create what's called a dam, and... and that'll change the direction of the water forever, and that's bad.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*So as long as we can avoid that, we should be able to splash around a little bit and we're all good.*

And as confirmed by this episode, **Deke was right**. When Loki and Mobius travelled to Pompeii, their travel there didn't create a branch and their actions, since they caused no big change to the flow of time in the Sacred Timeline, acted like sticks, causing no branch to be created!

That means Cap could have actually lived in the main timeline all this time in a loop as Markus and McFeely wanted!

**Of course, both theories could be correct, depending on how many and how serious changes Cap made to the Sacred Timeline’s flow of events when he went back in time, so it remains to be seen what type of story Marvel Studios will go with.**

However, the fact that Steve doesn’t appear back on the time machine platform and appears to not be wearing his time travel gear, along with the fact that the TVA would prune and reset the timeline Cap would have created, offers more credibility to the theory that Captain America lived out his life in the sacred timeline and was always Peggy’s husband.",1623909286,o1pw7j

marvelstudios,Loki TV show theory,"**Spoilers up to episode 2 + possible leaks**   
*   
*    
*   
This is a bit of a reach but stay with me...

Twitter has made a pretty compelling case for ""Lady Loki"" Actually being the Enchantress / Sylvie Lushton from the comics : https://www.themarysue.com/loki-episode-2-character-reveal-doubts/ 

- It was apparently leaked in the spanish credits,    
- a ""young Sylvie"" has been cast in the series (the actress is 14),    
- The colour of magic fits,   
- Loki labelled her magic as ""an enchantment"" (not a word used for his own magic as far as I can remember),   
- She didn't want to be called 'Loki',   
- Loki said that he'd never treat himself 'like this'.     
- She's blond

**My theory is that she is Loki's daughter in this version**    

- it would explain why she has 'Loki time energy' or whatever   
- Sylvie Lushton was apparently a mortal created by Loki in the comics. Her being his daughter is not a huge leap.   
- We know that there is a young Avengers movie coming out, and kid Loki was a young avenger in the comics. Again, not exactly the same as the comics, but not a huge leap either.   
- In the first episode they established that Loki would go hang out on earth for the fun of it when he was younger - the scene even shows him flirting with the air hostess. The scene was cool but seemed kinda pointless to me. If it was setting up a precedent for Loki messing around with earth women it would make sense.   
- Her hostility towards him in episode 2 would also make more sense if he is an absent father.   
- It would also give her a good motive for blowing up the 'sacred timeline' - since she isn't suppose to exist according to them.
- This last point is more abstract, but Loki as a character has always had his family relationships as a pretty core part of his character and character development. All his family is dead except for Thor, and that relationship already got resolved in the main timeline. I feel like it would just fit with his character to have a new family member to bounce off.    

Anyway my theory is that the Sylvie we see is either a young girl shape shifting, or the show will end with this Sylvie dying tragically, and Loki will go back in time to when she was young so he could be there for her - and then that version will be in the young avengers.",1623907675,o1pgd8
marvelstudios,Who started Multiverse?,[removed],1623907550,o1pf5h
marvelstudios,Why there are so many variants of Loki‽,[removed],1623907327,o1pcys
marvelstudios,The Temporal Position of the TVA [Loki Spoilers/Theory],"I was having a discussion with some friends about the location of the TVA and hope you all can appreciate my descent into madness. 

TL;DR The TVA is the nexus point at the end of the sacred timeline acting as a spindle, weaving the multiversal threads into what is the MCU. Read till the end for other crazy theories that simply scratch the surface of Absurdism and the nature of the relationship of writers, Kevin Feige, and Disney to the art they create. 

Initially I had thought that the TVA was a fifth dimensional location outside of the sacred timeline. How else could they have self referential events such as TVA agents dying and being investigated by other TVA agents, right? This would create paradoxes otherwise, I initially thought.

Well Owen Wilson made me go ""WoWwww"" for maybe the sixth time in my life when he said ""[the future]'s a work in progress"". Loki essentially asks how the future is written and that is what Mobius responds with. This defines that the TVA acts as a nexus point at the ever moving end of time. To frame it like Christopher Nolan, it acts as a Temporal spindle. The TVA combines all the multiversal threads (timelines) into the sacred timeline via God, Jesus, and the Holy spirit (The three time keepers aka Lizard people). The time keepers take individuals from these branching timelines and determine whether they get into the sacred timeline, into the TVA as bureaucrats/agents/minutemen (The chaotic existence Mobius refers to when asked where they come from), or pruned as the minutemen seem to do every 15 minutes in the show.  The TVA thusly has some agency over what they do because of their respective displacement from the temporal position from the base TVA spindle. They can feedback and weave into different aspects of the sacred timeline based on their reference point to the TVA spindle. 

For example, why don't the TVA bureaucrats know ahead of time that the bad/lady/evil Loki is going to split the timeline if they exist at the end of the sacred timeline? Everything that can happen should have happened and they would know if they are looking at the past! They cannot self reference events however that the TVA itself influences (understanding that the split is about to occur) otherwise it creates a paradox! The reason evil variant Loki can split the timeline without the TVA knowing it is going to happen (or any other murders she performs for that matter) is that the TVA, acting as a time spindle, must be displaced on the time axis or rather temporally move away from the event by a certain period of time. Prior to the event the agents that exist at the TVA have not committed the actions leading to the deviation so those existing at the spindle cannot know until those agents perform the actions that effect the sacred timeline! 

I hope this makes sense as I am kind of drunk and could probably use a diagram on a whiteboard to explain better ala It's Always Sunny. There is also other allegories to the writers of the MCU acting as these time keepers; weaving new stories that now become canon based upon their choices with directors acting as TVA authorities enforcing the pruning and focusing of the timeline through their directing, etc. Not to mention the absurd (not in the colloquial sense) philosophy behind how we all come from chaos and the TVA agents all exist in a time loop of sorts kind of how we traditionally experience time!!

P.s. the time keepers don't need to exist outside the timeline either to have free will and determine how the sacred timeline is woven because they were created at the beginning of time making them at the very front of the end of time and provide the reference frame of the entire MCU essentially. Basically they are the writers, The house of mouse, and Kevin Feige. They are also us in anything we experience or create as we act as our own reference point in our descriptions (stories) of temporal events.",1623907085,o1pagy

marvelstudios,My theory regarding Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Spoilers and Potential Spoilers),"In The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, we see Val, a mysterious woman who meets up with John Walker about still being a hero despite being disgraced as Captain America. In the end, she decided to give John the moniker of US Agent. But the question is, who is Val and why is she interested in John? As of now, it’s unknown. But here’s my theory. 

My theory is that Val is an associate of Thunderbolt Ross. Ross possibly brought along Val because he is planning to assemble his own team of avengers, possibly giving birth to the thunderbolts. In a bts set photo, we see Ross meeting up with Yelena Belova. My guess is that this is possibly a scene where Ross recruits Yelena to the thunderbolts in present time. I feel Ross would have his own avengers type team because well, the original team line up are no longer active plus wouldn’t the government be paranoid that there could be another Thanos and literally the world is missing some of the most important heroes are gone!",1623905589,o1ov38

marvelstudios,Fake Gauntlet,"Since we've already seen multiple infinity stones and Loki specifically mentions Ragnarok, do you think we will finally find out why Hela called the gauntlet in Odin's Treasure Room fake?

I always figured it was fake became the Tesseract and the gauntlet were in the same room, which wouldn't make sense because the space stone was in the Tesseract. There is no way the gauntlet would be complete without it.

It could also be because its the wrong hand? I'm still curious how SHE knew that and why Odin put it there to begin with. Its not like he gave daily tours of his Treasure Room.",1623902054,o1nt67
marvelstudios,What Loki says about Earth's 2040s to 2060s is a little concerning,"When they were checking through the list of apocalypses, Mobius mentions ""It's just one thing after another"": cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes, etc. They also talk about the Swallow going extinct, and a major climate disaster in the 2040s.

I.e., **The 2040s to the 2060s are dominated by climate and ecological crises.** It possibly is a cascade of environmental disasters. I wonder how the Avengers dealt with that one. Climate change isn't an enemy you can punch, or outsmart within a day.

Later, when Mobius is asking for clearance for the mission, he mentions that Haven Hills is a *corporate owned town* in Alabama. The billboard for the town has ""Presented by, Roxxcart"" on it, and Roxxcart's Supertstore seems to be where most people are gathered in a ""Disaster Shelter"" (I.e., disaster shelters are common in superstores during this era). During the disaster, there is no power anywhere in the town except in the supermarket (check the scene, all the homes and buildings around Roxxcart are in darkness). They have a hurricane sale, capitalizing on a disaster and encouraging people to shop during a life threatening event.

I.e, **Earth, or at least the US, grows into a hypercapitalist society with corporations gaining far more influence over people than today (reminiscent of the company towns of the late 1800s).**

Two very interesting points. I wonder if Marvel will still be making Marvel movies in the 2050s in our reality, and if they will keep this canon until then. Most likely not, but we'll see in about 30-ish years.",1623901265,o1nkfc
marvelstudios,It should’ve been Hulk,"I have no problem with Hulk for the majority of Endgame. Banner’s desire to finally be one with the Hulk make sense after the brutal beat down in Infinity War, and his snap contributes a lot to the final victory for the Avengers. But I’m sure many of us expected a rematch, and not having a ballistic Hulk beating the shit out of Thanos is a definite missed opportunity. 

So here’s my take. Knowing that Hulk and Banner merged, we should’ve seen more Hulk instead of just Banner. In the final battle, instead of Captain Mavel, Hulk should’ve rushed in and stopped Thanos from snapping. Reminding Banner of Natasha’s death would’ve put him over the edge, and no matter the outcome, knowing Hulk has some kind of closure fighting Thanos and avenging Natasha would’ve been a perfect ending for him in Endgame, instead of offscreening him for the entirety of the final battle.",1623901187,o1njia

I think Steve Rogers would listen to 40's music and some classic rock, once he found out about it,  and Nat totally listens to metal because she's just that edgy and hardcore. I think Peter probably listens to current music since he's the youngest. But like hipster music not mainstream pop

As for TV shows and movies: Clint probably can't stop comparing himself to Legolas whenever he watches LOTR and everyone jokes when they watch it together  by saying Legolas is better than him

I feel like Nat and Bucky wouldn't be able to listen to classical music because it reminds them of their pasts, I feel like someone in Hydra would play  it in the lab because they seem like they would love classical music and we know Nat was a ballerina

Tony probably watches HGTV because he loves making things and building stuff, and he finds it soothing. He'd do a ton of DIY projects, which annoys Pepper a little bit because he's always making so much noise with it and fixing things that don't need fixing, but to Tony, could be better

Cap probably watches documentaries and historical shows to catch up,  like The Crown, and then tells people all about it like they don't know any history and the rest of them just look at each other like ""listen to *this nerd* lol""

&amp;#x200B;

The Gobi Desert in ancient Mongolia (where Loki took the tesseract to) was a very important trade route. This combined with the strong cultural and religious views of the ancient Mongolians makes me think that the event that broke the sacred timeline could be the Mongolians seeing Loki.

Its actually 616 because these labels are completely arbitrary to the stories,"Even in the comic title of universe 616 had no real meaning and was used for a story. And while it eventually became the “main continuity” in the comics , it has zero effect on the movies since they don’t, and won’t, ever cross over. This means for the sake of the films and Disney plus shows, giving them a 616 designation changes nothing. It’s just label. We could call them world 1, or 5 and regardless the MCU is still the Main timeline for the films, so it makes sense that 616 is ALL OVER the MCU, because that’s what they want to call it.",1623857940,o17rh6

marvelstudios,"Thor: Ragnarok (2017), is the funniest, yet the saddest MCU movie so far.","In one movie, Thor lost just about everything he had, everything he held dear.

* Hammer.

Before it was crushed by his demented older sister, he used it for just about everything, but mostly to harness his powers, to control them.

Losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one, as his new friend Korg said.

* Eye.

Same sister stabbed out his eye.

* His long, beautiful hair.

It was cut by a creepy old man for no reason at all.

* His Girlfriend.

* His Throne:

All his life, he was told he was the oldest, the heir to the throne. Turns out he wasn’t.

* His Father.

In a way, he looked up to his father, and wanted to be like him. When he learned that his father was going to pass away he was clearly very distraught.

* Home.

Asgard. Ragnarok. The destruction of his home. His home blew to bits. Nothing remained of the beautiful place that was Asgard.

Apart from all that, he was enslaved and forced to fight for his freedom.

* Half of his people.

He fought with his sister, and rescued what was left of the people of his kingdom.

But just when you think things were going to start looking up for him, a mad titan appears, destroys his ship and kills half of his people.

(Kills his best friend and brother too, but that's in another movie: Infinity War.)

The remarkable thing about this movie is that it's one filled with so much loss yet many would say it's the funniest MCU movie so far.",1623842062,o12ffg

I didn't do my research on her though do i don't actually know who else she could bring into the MCU I just know that Monica Rambeau and Captain Marvel will be in it.

marvelstudios,I Think I Figured Out NWH,"First off, this fan theory works only if Morbius is indeed an MCU film, and even then, it still has a lot of kinks.

Will it play out beat for beat like this? Hell no. Are the main threads plausible and maybe even likely? Absolutely.

- Spider-Man (Holland) is on the run, Dr. Strange helps him out, yada yada yada.

- Both Garfield and Maguire will appear to help out Holland, but Maguire's role would be far larger than just helping to take down the Sinister Six.

- Will Maguire die? Yes, he would. This would actually tidy up this theory tremendously, whilst giving Maguire a fantastic arc, and having FFH still keep it's tragic consequences, all while diminishing the degree of Mysterio's damage to the fabric of the MCU, and Holland's spoiled identity.

Okay, with that out of the way, here it is.

Maguire dies after helping defeat the Sinister Six in the MCU universe, whatever happens to Garfield's Parker is irrelevant to this theory, as it is more than likely he will bounce between the MCU and SPUMC. Matt Murdock will convince the people of the MCU that Maguire's Spider-Man was the one who killed Mysterio, maintaining the fact that Peter Parker will remain known as Spider-Man in the MCU (which has been persistent in many leaks now), whilst maintaining Holland's Parker identity. Murdock can state that Maguire's Spider-Man is a multiversal threat (much like the Elementals Mysterio was fighting), that followed Mysterio into the MCU. Maguire, who is almost fifty, is a far more believable Spider-Man than a 17 year old nerd from Queens, which is a strong enough argument to win Peter's innocence in court.

So, Peter Parker will remain Spider-Man in the MCU, just not Holland's, who will remain anonymous. The court case, which boils down to the Daily Bugle smearing a 17 year old kid, will be court ordered to pay reparations to Holland, who will instead request a job, both fulfilling his photographer role, maintaining his unsuspecting role as Spider-Man, and making Holland's Spider-Man a menace in the MCU, as people will believe that the MCU's Spider-Man has similarly bad intentions as Maguire's. Now, nobody will suspect that Holland is Spider-Man, as he has literally been cleared in court, and The Daily Bugle cannot pick on Holland or surmise he is Spider-Man, as they took an obvious media hit during the court case for poor journalism (almost resulting in the destruction of an innocent kid's reputation).

Thus, it now makes sense why Keaton is in the Morbius trailer, and why the poster of Maguire's Spider-Man is labeled a 'murderer' as opposed to Holland's. As for the bus ad, Maguire is dead; so his version of Spider-Man would disappear from the face of the Earth.

Here is the kicker: Vulture still remains the only person who will see through Murdock's trick, as he does indeed know that Holland actually is Peter Parker. How this will play out? No clue. By the way, the MCU's Sinister Six still has to form, so in another Holland trilogy, by film six, I could definitely see this being the huge payoff, with Keaton leading his own Sinister Six, maybe becoming the person who saves Peter (as by then it would be a 1v6, as opposed to a 3v6 in this film). 

Hope you like my theory! Could've made it more story like, but this is am estimate, not fan fiction. I can only wish this multiverse stuff would wrap up this clean and in line with the comics.",1623816802,o0wel9
marvelstudios,What exactly did the TVA reset k. 2012?,"Whej yhey picked up Loki, literally right after he took the Tesseract, the TVA appeared and reset the timeline.

marvelstudios,"Falcon and the winter soldier, My thoughts; Rant so be prepared","I know I'm a bit late to TFATWS but I have some stuff to say.

First: IT ENDED SO GOD DAMN SOON LIKE I WANT AN EPISODE ***JUST***  FOR BUCKY MAKING AMENDS.

Number 2: This is rather a question than a rant but still. Am I the only one who liked the Bucky Scenes more than the Captain falcon ones? like Falcon is the main character of this show and not Bucky. well, it seemed like that anyway. the ending seemed to be setting up for a season two just like WandaVision and I need to know if I am the only one who wants more Bucky as a seriously like him as a character better like every single time he is pushed away because he was the winter soldier. now with that character growth plus pardons, I hope we see more of HIM onscreen in the future.

Number 3: I REALLY want the show to branch out more with the Bucky as I am genuinely interested in his more mundane life as much as the action scenes. I want to know about the girl at the diner, or him going house to house to make amends. I think they could've made at least a bit of effort and given him a cutscene as he goes house to house talking to the families of the people he had killed. I will repeat this again. I think CF is a great character in his own right but I think he should have gotten his own show as he is kinda stealing Bucky's thunder in this one.",1623814639,o0vsny
marvelstudios,Loki Villain Theories,"Now the popular theory is that the villain is a future version of the protagonist Loki who turned against the TVA, and this seems highly plausible, but I have another thought:

The villain could be Loki from a timeline where he defeated the Avengers and successfully conquered Earth. This would explain the scene where New York is in ruin. I think it would be a great foil for ""our"" Loki as he gets to meet the version of himself who has achieved everything he wanted and how he feels about it.

Of course this Loki would've become a variant the moment he won the Battle of New York and the TVA would've come after him, but maybe by using the Tesseract he managed to get away and has been eluding them since. And once having encountered them and knowing of their existence and power, he started plotting to take them down.

Alternatively, because they didn't reveal the villain's face at the end of the episode, it might also be a different form of Loki like Lady Loki.",1623814446,o0vqra

marvelstudios,Loki-inspired Endgame Theory,"While thinking about the first episode of Loki, I remembered Mobius telling Loki that the Avengers’ time travel was supposed to happen. At first I was like, “Clearly Loki didn’t see Dr. Strange raise his hand,” but then I realized that one possible reason only 1/14,000,605 futures actually worked out in the Avengers’ favor may have been because a good majority went against the Sacred Timeline, and the Avengers became variants that had to be eliminated by the TVA.",1623811570,o0ux1o
marvelstudios,"The actor who plays Homelander in The Boys, Anthony Starr, would be absolutely perfect to play Dr. Doom","So I’m finally watching The Boys, and I have to say I’m completely in love with it. It shows what would happen in the real world if superheroes existed, such as their status and power corrupting them, all the way to how much damage they’d do to a normal human body. And at the center is Homelander, the series equivalent of Superman. He plays a super powerful unhinged, charming maniac with the biggest ego ever so well it’s kinda scary. His overall demeanor and the way he acts would make him the most perfect pick for Doom imo. It’s one of those things where if you watch the show and think about it, it just clicks and seems like a perfect casting decision up there with Marvel’s best",1623811483,o0uw51
marvelstudios,Loki theory involving Gamora,"I've been thinking about Avengers: Endgame and how Gamora is missing at the end of it. She left her original path and ended up in the future (modern day). She may have been destined to join in the fight against Thanos and his army, but she went missing sometime after it was over since she's not at Tony's funeral. We then see Star-Lord trying to find her using the computer on his ship. I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps the TVA got a hold of her after the battle with Thanos was over for deviating from her path in the Sacred Timeline.",1623809991,o0ugr7

marvelstudios,What If: The Multiverse is [REDACTED],"# TL;DR - The Multiverse is collapsing in on itself and in hopes of repairing the events that transpired in Infinity War and Endgame. Variants are looking at the main canonical universe (MCU) for refuge or revenge while Dr. Strange, after using the Time Stone, looks elsewhere to prevent another Multiversal War.

&amp;#x200B;

* The series What If? explores the important variants throughout the Multiverse and how they will impact the oncoming war. Some have the generic heroes backstory and some have anti-hero elements, both of which will be needed.
* Loki fights the TVA since the TVA perpetuates Kang's ideology; the first part of the Multiversal War is the downfall of an established institution.
* Wanda plays into the variant's universe since she is a constant in the whole Multiverse.
* As the MCU moves forward, variants will pop in and out of the MCU (Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, America Chavez) and will think that it's just a nifty trick.
* In the ensuing chaos, heroes will die heroic deaths such as Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther and be replaced by a BP variant asks for refuge from a universe that died. Along with the King, he brought his queen, Ororo Munroe.
* The Eternals are only coming out right now because of the variant-hopping that's been happening lately. The second part of the Multiversal War is the 'big guns' are deployed.
* Whoever will be the big bad is, he/she will recruit villain variants from displaced universes. Variant Thanos, Variant Ultron, Variant Crossbones, etc.
* It will then be revealed that the Multiversal War that Miss Minutes said hasn't happened and the *other* constant in the Multiverse is tasked to fix the it all: Deadpool
* Wade Wilson, mishearing everything and disregarding every heroes pleas, *kills the Marvel Universe.*",1623807054,o0tm3l

marvelstudios,"I think I understand the way the Sacred Timeline works in ""Loki"". Can someone please tell me if I'm right or wrong?","So if I understand correctly, everyone on the timeline has free will, as do the TVA.  But if someone uses time travel and messes up the timeline to a critical point, either within their knowledge or not, they would start a multiversal war and destroy everything. So since the Avengers went back in time and got the stones, but then went back and returned them, it was supposed to happen because it didn't mess up the timeline to the point of destruction.

But if Loki starts a new timeline by escaping at the end of ""The Avengers"" then his future in the Sacred Timeline didn't happen yet. So if he has free will, then how did Mobius show him what would happen to him? That would imply that his future was predetermined and he has no free will.",1623805437,o0t5gm

marvelstudios,Which castmembers will fill the remaining 7 slots in Loki's closing credits?,"Hi all!

For Falcon and the Winter Soldier it was pretty fun to try and guess who was gonna fall in each of the slots for the final credits. Who would've guessed that JLD would get her own slot with a two-scene cameo??

So - I noticed that the final credits for Loki's first episode have a whooping 13 slots!! (Please, let me know if you counted different.) Of these slots, only 6 are filled:

1. Tom Hiddleston
2. ???
3. Gugu Mathba-Raw
4. Wunmi Mosaku
5. Eugene Cordero
6. ???
7. ???
8. ???
9. Tara Strong
10. ???
11. ???
12. ???
13. and Owen Wilson

Which bears the question - who will be in those 7 remaining slots???
I think that Sophia Di Martino (who will potentially play a female Loki) and Richard E. Grant (who will potentially play an older Loki) are a safe bet, and I would even dare to say they'll fall in slots 2 and 12, respectively (with Richard E. Grant getting an introductory ""with""). 
Who could go in the other slots? Rumoured additions such as Sasha Lane, Caley Fleming or Jack Veal? Rumoured returning castmembers such as Renne Russo, Jaimie Alexander or Karl Urban? Are we indeed getting Jonathan Majors??

marvelstudios,Another Loki Theory - The Other Loki Variant,"So I’ve seen some people speculating on the identity of Sophia Di Martino’s character in Loki. A lot of people seem to believe she will be playing Lady Loki and I agree. 

My theory is more about the motivation of both the TVA and the Loki variant they’re hunting. It goes as follows:

In another reality Loki was born female, which makes her a variant in the TVA’s eyes, so the TVA attempt to prune the branched timeline and take the baby, but are for some reason unsuccessful and the branch extends beyond the redline at which point they are unable to prune it. Then years later after learning of the TVA’s attack on her life and their attempt to destroy her reality she finds a way to strike back in order to prevent the TVA from destroying any more branched realities and harming other variants for things that are out of their control, like being born female.

I’m probably completely wrong and I’m sure whatever Marvel does will be better but I thought this could be an interesting way of bringing in Lady Loki and giving both sides of the conflict motivations that are understandable.  Let me know your thoughts!",1623792404,o0p166

marvelstudios,Loki will pickup Mjolnir at some point in the series.,"Now, I have no real indication of this happening based off anything in the show so far well other than Mobius seemingly wanting Loki to reach his full potential and that seems like a good way of showing that in a visual way. But, I could see this happening one of two ways well actually three ways sort of and they all have some comic ties. The first one and I think lamest one is that they just travel to a point in Asgard before Odin put the worthy enchantment on it and you just see Loki hold, but that does nothing for me. The other way is Loki meets a variant of himself where instead of being the God of Mischief he becomes the God of heroism this has precedent in the comics either he meets him and he's wielding mjolnir, but we don't stop their at this point in the series I'd want this to be later on. So not only do we have a Loki variant holding mjolnir, but at some point in this episode our Loki similar to Steve in Endgame maybe he's facing off against our villain Loki and then boom he sees mjolnir in a desperate attempt goes for it and picks it up. So yeah doesn't have to happen I think it be cool tho.",1623789184,o0nwgo

marvelstudios,"My Loki Theory! The TVA and Loki are STILL in a separate branch reality, not the ""Infinity Saga"" Timeline and the TVA is actually an illusion, you'll see why in my post","I believe that despite what the TVA says about how they see all, they are still in a separate reality from what I call the ""Infinity Saga"" timeline, **abbrievated I.S.T.** or Sacred Timeline for today's post. (IMPORTANT NOTE: **The Sacred Timeline** ***is*** **the Infinity Saga).**

Here's why I think this:

* Loki branched off into another reality and the TVA is something that happened to him *in that reality.* I don't believe that the TVA took Loki back to the Sacred Timeline, they just took him to a place within the Loki reality. As far as I can tell, the TVA exists out of time anyway because they are in a reality bubble, much like Wanda putting Westview in that kind of bubble. Same kind of bubble, but of course Wanda's not doing it this time. I think some other shadowy Phase 4 villain is.
* I still think the TVA and Loki are in a separate reality because we only found out the TVA existed *as we follow Loki after he branched off.* They either don't exist in the IST/""Sacred Timeline"" or, like the Eternals, don't interfere with the Sacred Timeline.
* However, since the show says the TVA does see the Sacred Timeline (Infinity Saga), it says they didn't interfere because it was supposed to happen. They're not, strictly speaking, *a part of the Infinity Saga timeline.* They just saw it happen. They, and Loki being in the TVA, are not part of it. However they clearly have the authority to apprehend variants from it. **Or they think they do because someone gave them that power. Question is, who?**
* I believe that the TVA itself is in fact an illusion even though they say they aren't.  ESPECIALLY after WandaVision, I would not be surprised. Even though they say it's not, and Loki can't use his magic, I still believe it is. **Why? Because Casey doesn't know what a fish is. He ""spent his whole life behind a desk."" It sounds like he** ***literally did, though. Literally.*** **He was born to work at the TVA, created only to do that, not to be a human man.**  In real life, people using that expression grew up in the world and would know what fish are. **I believe that the TVA and everyone in it was magically created, born as staff, and their sole purpose is to work at the TVA and hunt Variants. They were created to do it, like robots. The TVA has to be an illusion, or someone's army only disguised as humans, whether or not they admit it.**
* Another reason why I think the TVA is an illusion is because I can't figure out the answer to **this question: Why don't they consider** ***their own timeline*** **to be the Sacred Timeline? Because I think Casey, if not anyone else,  knows they don't** ***actually exist.*** Think of timelines like lives: Everyone has one. A person's life is sacred to them, and whatever happens in a person's life is their own ""sacred timeline"". But the TVA don't call their own timeline/lives ""The Sacred Timeline,"" making me think that their ""lives' have no value to them, because in that reality,  **they are not actually alive or even fully human.** They were created, they're fake people. If they were real, they would definitely call *their own timeline* ""The Sacred Timeline."" **But they don't.** But I will say that maybe the reason why the Infinity Saga is the sacred timeline is because it was the reality with the power to affect all other realities within the multiverse. But that doesn't change my theory though. 
* If Loki finds a way to get out of the TVA or go ""beyond it"", I'm sure it would be an illusion.  I think the TVA is some sort of Wanda-esque magical bubble. I think, whatever Mobius and the guards say, the TVA is in fact an illusion or in a reality bubble within whatever reality Loki branched off to from Endgame.",1623786812,o0n19v

Leaving a whole lifetime for Kang to exist, but then Kang would have to contend with the fact that he lives in a time line that shouldn't exist and a time line that will end soon.",1623781427,o0l0pj

marvelstudios,Minimum MCU movies before Infinity War/Endgame?,"After reading [a thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nz8d4m/my_wife_finally_watched_infinity_war_and_words/) recently about a guy who got his wife to watch all of the MCU, and then he described her reaction to seeing IW and EG for the first time (I highly recommend his posts!)... 

I thought about trying to get my wife to get to Infinity War/Endgame.  My wife hasn't watched any of the MCU movies.  Doesn't consider herself a superhero fan.  But this got me to thinking... if I was able to get her to watch a few MCU movies before IW/EG, **what is the minimum set of movies that would make IW/EG worth it?**

Obviously I'm not going to pressure my wife to watch anything she doesn't want to, so each movie has to be entertaining by itself, pretty stand-alone without too much required viewing of other movies, but at the same time pretty important for IW/EG since I don't want her to lose interest.

I'm thinking:

* Iron Man.  Started it all.  RDJ is dashing.  There's plenty of really funny humor.  An origin story.  In fact, the origin story for the whole Avengers Initiative.

* The Avengers.  Get to see the group in action.  Get to see an Infinity Stone, even if we don't know what that is yet.  Doesn't require too much previous knowledge.

* Thor/Ragnarok.  Really fun.  Sure, there's lots of references to Asgard's history, but I still think it would work well as a stand-alone movie for someone who hadn't seen the previous Thor movies.  And it ends with &gt;!Asgard being wiped out and the Asgardians heading out on their space ship!&lt; ... leading straight into Infinity War.

(Meanwhile, I love all of the Captain America movies by themselves, but I don't think they're hugely important for IW/EG.)

marvelstudios,Who would you like to see play a villain?,[deleted],1623777033,o0jbrm
marvelstudios,In defense of Kaecilius as a villain,"In case you’ve forgotten, Kaecilius is the villain of Dr Strange played by Mads Mikkelsen

I think the primary argument against Kaecilius is that he doesn’t have much depth or pathos like the great villains like Thanos, Killmonger and co. But I think this isn’t necessarily a bad thing in his role as the villain of this movie.

His role as villain isn’t the same as him being a 3 dimensional character. The villain is mainly supposed to serve a specific thematic role for the narrative above them being sympathetic or emotionally deep or anything like that. And one of the main themes of Dr Strange is that Steven Strange is NOT the center of the universe. Strange is so self-centered at the beginning that he must be literally shown the vastness of existence across time and space to even begin his character arc of realizing he isn’t that important. That scene which would humble anyone in real life is just the start of strange maybe becoming humble 1 hour later into the movie. That’s how self centered he was.

And so it’s imperative for the narrative that Strange isn’t the actual cause of the conflict or even the escalation of the conflict. Kaecilius begins the movie hating the Ancient One while the ancient one feels regret and shame over Kaecilius and Strange does nothing to affect this relationship. Typically, you would expect either kaecilius or the ancient one to be the MC since the drama is mainly around them. The student master betrayal. The secret of the dark dimension only matter to them specifically. And yet Strange is the MC.

Another self centered MC is Tony stark but his lesson wasn’t to learn to not be self centered so the story still made itself about him in every way. The villain is his jealous uncle. The conflict around weapon technology is entirely of his creation. Which is a stark contrast to Strange. In fact Strange is the ONLY Marvel MC who is this detached from the actual drama and stakes of the movie, so that it is clear that he is simply a small part of this greater universe.

Dr Strange has to learn to be a servant for mankind basically. Risking eternity fighting Dormammu for others. And the story reflects how much of a sacrifice this is by not giving him personal stakes in this.  He simply has to choose to do the right thing for others because he is to become a servant for everyone else.

Because of this deliberate choice, Kaecilius isn’t a deep character since we are seeing everything from Strange’s outsider POV. This is the equivalent of Darth Vader fighting Obi Wan while Luke watches on. We have no idea the true depth of emotions between those other people fighting and we are even more detached than Luke because at least then Obi Wan knew Luke personally way more than the ancient one knew Strange and Darth Vader had killed Luke’s father (from a certain point of view) while Kaecilius had no personal anything with Strange.

In conclusion, I think a bit too much weight is put on “depth in villains” when sometimes a bad guy is just supposed to be a bad guy. Kind of like Mysterio in Far from Home. And people see Kaecilius as a failure of a villain because the very nature of Dr Strange as a story is supposed to have him much less involved with Strange than any other marvel movie. To the point that the actual end is Strange defeating Dormammu instead of Kaecilius since there wasn’t anything built up between them, VERY INTENTIONALLY SO.",1623776967,o0jauj

marvelstudios,"[SPOILERS LOKI S01E01] - In-depth breakdown and commentary - S01E01 ""Glorious Purpose"".","So this is what I call a deepwatch. In a deepwatch, I like to think about the episode in terms of inner motivations and previously established ideas, analyse as much as I can in a scene, and comment on how everything comes together. (I've done this before for _The Umbrella Academy_ season 1, which you can find a link to [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UmbrellaAcademy/comments/gi7bo6/spoilers_for_all_s01_indepth_breakdown_and/) if you're interested.)

This is gonna be a long bloody post, be prepared for some deep fucking analysis. Goes without saying that **you should not be here if you haven't watched the episode**, cause this will totally and utterly spoil basically everything in it, but I'll say it anyway. Movie spoilers too, especially for the movies Loki has been in previously. If you have any feedback, please leave a comment! I want to start a discussion, that's how we come up with more ideas. I tentatively plan to do this for each episode, and I will update each post as new episodes shed light on the happenings in previous ones, because that's always interesting to think about too - helps us extrapolate as to what might end up happening later on.

In addition, I have not read the comics, please point out anything I might have missed in this regard.

------------

**S01E01** - *Glorious Purpose*

- The title is part of 2012 Loki's catchphrase. He discovers the immense irony of this over the course of the episode. I can't say at this point if he has found a new ""glorious purpose"" by the time the end credits roll, but his old one is shattered into about a billion pieces.

- Some extra reaction shots have been added to the *Endgame* footage that begins the show, emphasizing Loki's reactions to the event, and how this is now Loki's point of view. (This makes this scene also different from the first _Loki_ trailer's version of the _Endgame_ scene.) This also sets up for the later reveal that Loki deduces that the Avengers are meddling with time. The new shots I can see are the close up on Capt. America!Loki, the close-up on Loki waving to Hulk in the elevator, and a dramatic look-backwards when Loki sees Endgame!Tony grabbing the Tesseract and making a beeline for the stairs.

- I note the score in this scene is also different from _Endgame_ - although it uses the main Avengers motif, it has more ticking, mystery and ominous-ness around it. _Endgame_'s version is lighter and played more for laughs, in an ""everything's going wrong, haha"" sort of way. 

- Interestingly, there are now three instances of this event in the MCU - the original in _The Avengers_ (which does not explore what happened immediately after Loki asked for a drink - so there was no snarky illusory play, or Hulk-taking-the-stairs issues, or any confrontation in the lobby, whether from Pierce or time-travelling doppelgangers - seen in that movie), the failed Tesseract retrieval seen in _Endgame_, from Tony, Steve and Scott's POV, and now from Loki's POV in _Loki_. I wonder if the 'wave' was reshot not only for emphasis of Loki's POV, but also because ultimately a variant of Loki must always escape to be recruited by the TVA, and his little sarcastic wave contributes to Hulk's anger and frustration when opening the ground floor stair door, which ends up manoeuvring the Tesseract back into Loki's hands.

- Maybe more of an _Endgame_ commentary, but the wave's timing is very much in character for Loki. He sees that both Thor and Tony will not let Hulk in, and only waves when he sees the elevator doors closing. In the Endgame footage, we focus on Hulk, seeing him punch the elevator doors and walk over to the stairs, but in this episode, we stay with Loki waving in the lift and only *hear* the Hulk's punch.

- Hiddleston seems to have some (appropriate) trickster eyes, just off this one episode - sometimes they're a shocking blue and other times they're a soft hazel or a muted green. No idea if this is CGI or if casting is basically Watcher-level lmao. I notice in this Endgame scene, his eyes are mostly green.

- Hiddleston seems to have grown out and dyed his hair for the series, something I don't think he has done since 2011 and the first *Thor* - he's been making use of wigs in the other movies. Maybe it's easier makeup wise, less time especially being on set every day as the focal point of the show. Unfortunately his real hair is thinning at the temples and is also slightly shorter in length than 2012 Loki's hair. You can see the difference between the *Endgame* footage, and the extra shots added in by this show, not to mention the Gobi Desert scene. His hair barely goes past his shoulders in the new scenes, whereas it does in the Endgame footage. The wave in the elevator has Loki with ever-so-slightly different hair (shorter in length and retreating hairline, sorry mate), so my conclusion was that this was filmed with the Loki series, whereas I believe the other two shots are simply extra unused Endgame takes. Perhaps he should have used extensions, at least until the scene of him getting his TVA jumpsuit. Could have probably hand-waved a haircut there (maybe even a goddamn wash! Dude's mane was looking pretty bloody greasy in _Avengers_) and it'd've made a nice allusion to Thor getting his hair cut short in *Ragnarok*.

- The first _Loki_ trailer containing the _Endgame_ footage suggested a Bifrost-like journey through space before landing in the desert ([here](https://youtu.be/PlpjPCssEXE?t=26))  - was this to make us think that Loki was no longer on earth at that point? I think so, and I also think that this Bifrost journey is another tiny snippet from a future _Loki_ episode, used in the wrong place as trailers often do. I reckon we'll do that trip again, but in proper narrative order.

- Alright, the episode here cuts into the Marvel Studios intro sequence. It's different from the last two Disney+ shows - for one, the score is a new composition, unique to _Loki_ - slow, deep and  mysterious, almost sad, using theremin heavily, a little synth - whereas _WV_ and _FATWS_ used the usual intro score. In addition, the intro sequence here is _after_ the 2012 scene, whereas the premieres of _WV_ and _FATWS_ had the Marvel Studios intro sequence before showing anything else. Intro length and images used in the sequence appear consistent, but the end logo ends up tinted Loki green and gold. (Fuck yeah. I was so bloody excited seeing this for the first time. I think the only time they've adjusted the logo colour like this was for Black Panther.)

- cut to some sand and the reflection of a weird CGI black bug with yellow spots in a water droplet. I have no idea what this means. Why would you even add this into a scene? I wonder if it's a reference to a later development?

- And we open to a little blue dot streaking across the desert sky and cannonning into the sand. Goddamn, why is he in the sky? Can't Loki control where he goes with the Tesseract? Perhaps he wasn't thinking far enough ahead to decide on a destination. Just somewhere as far away as possible from the Avengers lol, in which case he's lucky he didn't land in the Indian Ocean, New York's antipode! He also can't very well go home to Asgard, or to somewhere in space Thanos' court can't find him at this point. So, somewhere far away on Earth, where he can hopefully pick up the pieces and rework his plans for global domination, lol.

- Loki lands in the Gobi desert, bits of shackle everywhere (too much debris? those shackles weren't that big, and he's not wearing any other restraints besides the asgardian cuffs and the metal gag). Reminds me of Iron Man crashing in the desert. Is this scene then promising a similar warmongering-asshole-to-hero plot?

- Very much in character for this Loki to leap onto a nearby rock, putting him above everyone else in the scene, and begin trying to conquer the resident population. The confidence-in-strength and magnified resentment the sceptre gives him is gone, however, and he is still smarting from being trounced by those he thought were merely ants. The word from Marvel is that Loki was affected in some way by the sceptre, as was Hawkeye, and the solution to the mind control as seen in _Avengers_, was to get clocked in the head. Getting Hulk smashed, ragdoll style, has to qualify for that. He's far more jokey and unsure after getting metronome-mashed and having his angry-stick taken away from him. (Please note that this does not excuse his invasion of Earth or his shitty actions in _Thor_.) In addition, Loki in _Ragnarok_ was able to access others' memories without the Mind Stone, which could be implied to be an existing ability, as he knows Black Widow's history - regardless, the powers from the Mind Stone kinda seen like a known, familiar quality to him, and fit well with his existing power set and talents. But the sceptre and its stone are back in New York, and he can't use them as both a crutch and a protection mechanism anymore; and it shows. This is the second crack in his carefully developed defences, the first being the actual loss to the Avengers. Those defences are gonna be pretty FUBAR'd by the time the credits roll.

- Jumping onto that rock has another advantageous effect - it's kinda obvious that they had to film Hiddleston for this scene separately from everyone else, and having the stand-in higher up means that you don't see the back of their head when the other characters are in frame. Pulled me out of the scene a little, I must say. 

- Very cool and in character to have his first words in the series proper be his catchphrase. ""I am Loki, of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."" He starts off kind of tired, actually (you can hear it on the ""of Asgard"" -  a 'here we go again' vibe). First signs that the facade could be slipping.

- I wonder if the Mongolians can actually understand him? The scene seems to be played so one can take either impression.

- Suddenly, he sees the TVA entry team, clocks that they're more powerful than the natives and that they're closer to the Tesseract than he is, and goes over to confront them. Interestingly, Loki doesn't  take the Tesseract with him before trying to monologue at the natives, surely it'd be more threatening, and give him a bit of a confidence boost? Maybe we can chalk this up to still being kinda off after that landing.

-  This 2012 Loki, fresh from his defeat at the hands of the Avengers, with his blustery little speeches being cut off, ignored, or derailed, reminds me of another unpredictable trickster, Captain Jack Sparrow - [*grandiose*] ""You will remember this as the day you almost-"" [*gets drenched by massive wave* / *gets knocked out* / *gets talked over* / etc.]

- Introduction of Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15. I wonder if she has an actual name, because that just sounds like a title, and we do meet other characters with normal names like Casey. (Mobius M. Mobius on the other hand is a weird fucking name, almost like a pseudonym. Hmmmm.) Anyway, B-15 seems methodical and no-nonsense and deals with Loki in like 15 seconds. (Avengers [binoculars]: write that down, write that down!)

- Some nice bass synth as Hunter B-15 comes in. She doesn't even look at Loki as she comes in, and you know instantly that he's next to nothing in her eyes. (To her, not only is her organisation powerful far beyond anything in this universe, he's not even the 'real' Loki, just a copy.)

- The helmets look very Kraut. They're only missing the spike. Nod to the fascistic tendencies of the TVA?

- These time cannon things look like futuristic truncheons. Reminds me of those big-ass sticks from _A Clockwork Orange_. Probably intentional. I note that the business end can be different colours, possibly indicating different effects. When B-15 uses the stick on Loki, it's purple, and I see another guy in the background with an orange stick. Same as the colours of the reset charge, which makes a good deal of sense.

- ooooooh. Getting hit with the time stick looks like it doesn't half-sting, huh? If Loki had residual Mind Stone issues going on, then I'm gonna take a wild guess and say he certainly isn't gonna have them now. The lip movements don't look entirely correct for being smashed to the side like that, but whatcha gonna do? Hit him in the face with a stick for real? I don't think anyone is that much of a method actor lol

- We don't see what a reset timeline looks like when the charge goes off (besides a slowly widening strangely-coloured circle under the charge), but by the way Loki's eyes widen (he doesn't even see the whole thing, just a glimpse), it might not be particularly fun. (There's even a quick shot of some of the Mongolians, just to underscore that this charge will affect them too.) I assume what 'resetting the timeline' involves will be a plot point later in the series. The charge itself looks like a two-chambered affair, and the plunger at the top disturbs the orange contents of one vial, breaking it, seemingly allowing two substances to mix into purple and have their effect.

- Okay, we had three other TVA personnel with us in the previous scene but only B-15 reappears with Loki through the portal. Not sure where the other three fucked off to. Maybe they portalled straight to the locker rooms lmao. I guess they're not responsible for processing Variants from the timeline, since B-15 has Loki in hand.

- Also, just wanted to point out, this is one lady in armour, frogmarching the supervillain of _Avengers_ down a corridor with one hand while holding the Tesseract in the other. This is some Worf Effect shit.

- Variant Skrull! They've got a collar too. Wonder what they did to impugn the Sacred Timeline. This one I swear I saw in _Captain Marvel_.

- aha! We get another Variant character, apparently human this time, some snotty cashed-up twerp. This poor asshole is gonna be a painful example for Loki later on, but right now, he serves as an fall-guy introduction for the audience and a distraction for Loki to use to try and run away.

- I like the set up of the little time twister control and collar. You get to see Loki trying to get away, and B-15 bringing him back by resetting his position in his personal timeline, which doesn't affect his memory of what happened, similar to the time stick used earlier, and after the second attempt, you see him pulling at his collar, which connects the little remote B-15 is holding to the collar he's wearing. I'm unsure as to the period of time that is controlled by the time twister (as in how far back you can reset someone's personal timeline with it), but I foresee it being used to trick future antagonists, not just B-15 as happens later this episode, because of this thorough introduction.

- At 5:41 here, in the close up on B-15, you can see a whole bunch of etched tally marks, maybe 60 or 70, on her helmet,  Timelines reset? Variants captured? Variants pruned? Kind of ominous. A nice detail that underlines that this ain't her first rodeo.

- I reckon her little ""oh, you"" face when Loki tries to run away is hilarious. 

- A little peeved Loki didn't try to use illusions or magic right here, in the attempt to get away from B-15. Maybe he was saving it up for the right moment, thinking that the TVA didn't know he could use magic, or maybe it was just plot-driven dumbassery.

- Here's Casey! So the TVA guy with the variant Skrull seemed to go through the full signing-in-a-Variant process, but B-15 just shoves Loki's Tesseract at him and tells him to log that shit. Either indicative of B-15's brusque personality, or perhaps a kind of general disrespect that field personnel have for the office guys. We'll have to wait and see which.

- lmao ""It's the Tesseract. Be very careful with it."" ""Sounds stupid."" First sign that things are not what they seem, Casey picks up the Tesseract with bare hands (B-15 is wearing gloves). So far, no run-of-the-mill mortals have touched Infinity Stones with bare hands without consequence. The other thing is that these guys don't seem to know anything about the Tesseract. We'll come back to that later...

- ""You cross me, there are deadly consequences."" Delivery's okay, but it's slowly starting to feel like a part Loki is putting on, like Shakespeare in the park, and he's becoming less convincing (and convincing himself less) each time.

- by the way, set looks very orange 1960s-1970s retro futuristic bureaucracy, a real switch up from the previous shows and even previous movies. I'm getting like _Brazil_, _Blade Runner_ and _Men in Black_ vibes. Anyone played _Control_? That whole bureaucratic vibe (except that's more like a 50's vibe to me). It's an awesome game, highly recommend. Also _We Happy Few_.

- lmao _Loki_ set boss apparently said let's just shove Hiddleston in a dressed-up lift for this bit. Cute

- lmao Loki complaining about the machine scuffing his leather. Fighting new humiliation at every turn, slowly being stripped of all of his little stereotypes. I like that the machine looks worried for a second before pulling out the laser like ""oh maybe he will like this better?""

- lmao Loki stuttering in embarassment after getting his armour lasered off. Loki's surprisingly ripped, a lot more muscly than he came across in prior films - he seemed small and lithe in _Thor_, for example. Anyway, cheers for the workout, Hiddleston 👍

- It's borderline weird seeing Loki in anything other than leather or Asgardian-style garb. He only dons other outfits when 'undercover' in Midgard, and those outfits are invariably impeccably tailored and stylish. (You can see that even in this episode, via D. B. Cooper's styling; a gorgeous dark blue three-piece, plus a little tiepin with some kind of green stone inset, which fit the historical Cooper's description. Hiddleston's hair is slicked back but seems shorter in this scene, I think - I'm wondering if they filmed that scene last, so his hair could be cut to show this as a different, earlier Loki?) Thor is the one who walks around with his guns out; Loki prefers long sleeves. (In *The Dark World*, when Prime Loki finds out his mum's dead and has a breakdown, that's the most casually dressed we ever see him, and he's still wearing long sleeves and full-length leggings.) Before this, I couldn't have imagined Loki in so much as a t-shirt. That's all been turned upside-down. His leather armour is literally fucking vapourised and he gets shoved unceremoniously (and somewhat impossibly) into a utilitarian TVA-labelled, beige-coloured, short-sleeved jumpsuit and dinky Velcro sneakers between shots. This is the most skin Loki has ever displayed in the whole MCU - lends him even more of a sense of vulnerability and fish-out-of-waterness.

- aww, cute surprised kitty! Possible flerken? Unsure. There's an uneaten sandwich on the piles of paperwork in here.

- lol, there's like multiple levels of surprise on Loki's face in this scene. First to find himself clothed, then the cat, then the TVA office guy. Loki's starting to look like a lifer in prison in his jumpsuit, lol

- Clock behind the TVA guy has multiple hands, just like the one that appears in the credits. If time doesn't pass normally in the TVA, how do these clocks measure time? Also, it looks like the set team have taken a bunch of 24hr clocks and modified them - the usual 6-o'clock position is taken by the 12. I guess it makes sense to be in some kind of 24hr time, you can't see outside in here, and from the wider TVA seen later on, I don't see a sun or a moon or anything that could help with knowing the time of day.

- I personally prefer the delivery of this ""sign for everything you have ever said"" moment from the trailer better. But I still like how Loki buttons his lip and grabs the pen so that he won't have to wait for more printer paper to sign, lol. You can feel the ""wtf??"" and resigned frustration just coming off him in waves. When he stands back, dude looks like he's contemplating every single one of the life choices that led to this wacky moment.

- from the movement of the pen, he's written his name in English, and with a lowercase L to start with. It's almost like malicious compliance, the bare level of satisfaction lol. ""You want me to sign??? Alright, I'll motherfucking sign!!!"" 

- This better be like newfangled multisided quantum TVA paper, where you can keep turning the paper over to see new information. Cause there is no way that this piddly little stack is _everything_ Loki has ever said in his life. Even Mobius talks about this in this very same episode.

- Loki forgot the trap-door in the floor, and growls at it for a second. What's even more hilarious is that there _are_ doors (and even queue ribbon things either side of the door!) in all of these rooms, just that he never gets the chance to use them except when he's pushed into this weird-ass pseudo-assembly line.

- and into the temporal aura thingo! Loki can feel some kind of energy (?) field, indicated by a buzzing noise to us, in the archway, so he doesn't walk in straightaway.

- Perfectly in character to worry about whether he's a robot or not - it was only very recently that Loki found out he was adopted and not even the species he thought he was, in the grand scheme of things. Also, he can see weird silver-black gunk on the walls of the archway, in what looks like a blast pattern. That'd worry me too.

- Finally Loki gets to use a door like a normal person, lol. The ticket machine says, ""Your Turn Automatically - Take a Tab"". Hundreds of ceiling lights wash the whole scene yellow, and there's another of those weird-ass clocks in the back.

- The back of the ticket sign says ""Warning! Processing Protocols. Proceed in an orderly fashion through the processing line. Speak only when spoken to by an authorised TVA agent. No Talking, No Fighting. Violators will be dealt with harshly. Miss Minutes welcomes you.""

- TVA guard purses his lips when Loki belligerently holds up his ticket. Lol, actor trying to keep a straight face?

- Putting the ticket in his pocket sets up the idea of pockets in Loki's jumpsuit, and things he could put in those pockets, without any need for magic. Very good.

- ""Hey there, you're probably saying, 'This is a mistake, I shouldn't even be here!'"" Could there be a chance Miss Minutes is omniscient lmao? Probably just a joke (she doesn't get the exact wording of Loki's outburst correct), but she is also on the series's poster, and I don't want to underestimate her. On the other hand, there's a poster in the background that says ""Everything here watched and recorded"".

- this little animation is top-notch. Reminds me of the Jetsons, Hanna Barbera stuff. Very cool, and very informative (although it pays to be aware that this is probably history as written by the victors). Scored very well, theremin comes back.

- the little yellow character's bowtie flops loose as he becomes a variant, and this little floppy undone tie dude is the same variant shown later who punches in late. All the versions of the character still have the same bow-tie somewhere on their person (all with eeeeevil furrowed eyebrows, lol) but have other distinguishing characteristics.

- Mention of 'multiverse' and 'madness', both title words in the upcoming ""Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness"". Also, in order for Doctor Strange to be concerned about a Multiverse of Madness, doesn't there need to *be* a multiverse in the first place? The TVA may not be as in control at the end of this series as they are at the beginning.

- You can commit a crime against the Sacred Timeline by being late for fucking work. That's stupid. The TVA don't seem to be very good guys at this point in time, but I guess that's how you make us cheer for someone who would otherwise be the villain in a piece - introduce something even more evil.

- the animation says the workers at the TVA were 'created' to serve the Time-Keepers, which Mobius doesn't deny later. Maybe they were all variants at some point, it's just that they don't know it. Or they're all types of robot, to add extra weirdness to that ""am I a robot?"" scene.

- here's that annoying fall-guy from before, meeting his horrible end at the business end of an _orange_ tipped time stick. Gets Loki to behave himself (bet you he was the paragon of politeness when he got to the processing window, all pleases and thankyous), was perhaps the fate of all those in Loki's reset timeline (note the strange shimmery blue colour as that guy disappears, it's similar to the colour and effect that spreads out from the charge in the reset timeline), establishes this feeling of being pruned as being unpleasant, if not outright painful, and tells us exactly what the orange end of the stick does. I wonder if we will see the Prime version (shut up Amazon) of this dude as a cameo in later movies or Disney series, he seems well-characterised and recognisable, if not particularly likeable at this point lol.

- lol Loki frantically trying to find his ticket after the dude gets pruned. [Indy Jones reference](https://youtu.be/oRSQi97RRzk)! Fuck, I should rewatch those movies, they're awesome.

- ""Thanks for visiting the TVA, don't hesitate to let us know how we're doing!"" Is Miss Minutes saying that because the guy got pruned?? Fuck, that's dark.

- Ticket number above the processing window is 8365129. That could be how many got processed. Unfortunately that doesn't count how many got pruned before reaching the window. Brr.

- Twelve minutes in, we finally get the title card. Loki's name, each letter changing font as the score's clock theme ticks away. Slowly the letters stop changing; first the L, then the K, then the I, then finally the O, to match the promo logo. Shapeshifting, eat your heart out. This show is gonna be about identity. Who are you at your core? Can you change that? Anyway, looks fucking awesome, I love this logo far better than the luridly-coloured one on the promo material. Score is fucking A+, thank you Natalie Holt. Getting like Hans Zimmer _Inception_ vibes? Aaaah, I can't think what this white on black, old-tape-style title card reminds me of. Hopefully someone else will read this and let me know...

- And cut to Owen Wilson making his debut in the MCU! Wilson's grey hair gives me Vincent-from-_Collateral_ vibes (an awesome movie I highly recommend); he looks like someone who has gone grey prematurely, especially with Wilson's naturally round, boyish face. (Wilson's 52 years old! He certainly doesn't look it, neither does Mobius, his character, and that with the grey hair emphasizes the man-out-of-time look.) This role looks and feels very different from Wilson's usual performances; there's a serious, seen-it-all quality about his character, even though a sense of playfulness and optimism shines through in his interactions with other characters. Overall, he comes across as understanding, to the point of feeling like he's channelling fucking Oogway from Kung Fu Panda lol.

- So Mobius is investigating the massacre of a Minutemen team + their Hunter (team leader, sounds like). Once again, there's four in the team as seen in the little TVA information cartoon, and when Loki got brought to the TVA. One Hunter, three Minutemen. Looks like they're in a church in France in 1549. I note what looks like a St. Joan of Arc stained glass window - this is around a hundred years after her death, so it makes sense for that to be there. So what caused the nexus event that the Minutemen responded to?

- Mobius' belt buckle is very big and silver. Wondering if it says TVA, but I can't tell.

- Hunters seem to have a designation that starts with a letter, stencilled in orange on their helmets. Minutemen have only a number, lengthy and stencilled in white, in smaller sized font. The Hunter escorting Mobius appears to be U-92, whereas Mobius seems like a detective of some kind, as opposed to U-92's time-cop routine. Can't tell if he's also the type to put tally marks on his helmet like B-15.

- U-92 says it's the sixth attack in a week, and Wilson's character adds, 'that we know of'. The commonality so far seems to be that the TVA team is surprised, and dies to a man from stab wounds, the reset charge is stolen, and they think it's a 'he'. Hooded!Loki getting bloody busy. He would have at least six charges by now (we don't know if there were attacks last week).

- U-92 speaking better French than Mobius, lmao. Also confirmation the TVA guys speak everything.

- I can't believe this 1500s kid is reacting like this, he must be in shock or something. So he saw this killer that he associates with the devil, killer gave him lollies, then more weirdly dressed guys show up through some portal and present him with a stick-guy animation on some magic window thing. I would have hidden under a table or run away screaming. Why is the Devil on stained glass anyway? Is that a thing? (One Google later - it *is* a thing.)

- Thought this kid was a girl at first. It's the mediaeval hairstyle, perhaps. Softer features when you're younger.

- ""Don't worry, that devil is scared of us. We're gonna take care of him."" (In English. For emphasis to the audience? Since the kid is supposed to be French and should not be able to understand this?) Is that devil (the Loki variant) actually scared of them? Is this something Mobius is saying to reassure himself?

- obvious electric guitar riff when the kid hands over the anachronistic gum. Very out of place in 16th century France (both the guitar and the gum).

- So the gum has to be scanned for changes in temporal aura. Sooo, when you travel through time, your aura changes? They wanted a photo of Loki from before... which would maybe show if he had been timeline-hopping before he encountered B-15? Just spitballing here. This Loki variant seems to know what they're doing and U-92 doesn't think they'll find anything.

- I get the feeling Mobius wants the variant kid to see the sun and be outside one last time before the timeline is reset. That's pretty sad. Also very empathetic. Mobius is so bloody nice, holy moly. This guy better not turn out to be an evil dick. (Although, I'd love to see Wilson play an evil dick, that'd be fun to watch.)

- sooo how bad is this Loki variant anyway? He didn't kill the kid, gave him gum, and stopped the Minutemen wiping out his timeline (which could possibly be painful, as established in the processing scene with the dickhead fall-guy). Maybe he's a vigilante, champion of variants, trying to bring about the multiverse. Right now, the TVA aren't looking amazingly heroic.

- Mobius gets handed a file on the Loki variant we're following in this series. Looks like Loki is 6 foot 2, which Google tells me is Hiddleston's actual height. Dude hasn't been looking particularly 6 foot 2 until now (probably because he's not standing next to bloody Thor anymore lmao).

- cut back to the TVA. Loki's guided into a courtroom (apparently Time Court 37 judging by the wall) by B-15. Courtroom itself looks like it got pulled out of Soviet Russia. Big almost religious looking propaganda murals (orange is the main colour, not red). Brutalist architecture. Even the gallery seats look like church pews. Two murals look at the Time Keepers and how they created the Sacred Timeline (chopping off timeline branches with a sword, lovely), the next mural shows the Minutemen and Hunters, the fourth the office staff, and the last one, the Judges. (Looks like Stan Lee's some kind of Judge-adjacent figure, since his picture has a medal and not a Judge sash, which might go some way to explaining his appearances across the MCU.)

- Here is Judge Renslayer's (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) first appearance, although she does not introduce herself in the courtroom.

- These numbers (""sequence violation 7-20-89"") mean nothing to me. Do they refer to a date? Someone's birthday? In the same vein, I wonder if this Loki's variant number, L1130, means anything.

- Goddamn, they're calling this guy Laufeyson and he's not turning a hair. Dude massacred the Jotun and killed his own father as a repudiation of his lineage, I'm thinking he should be touchy about the name they're calling him. On the other hand, I reckon he'd be outright miffed if they called him Odinson at this point.

- ""Madam, a god doesn't plead."" 10/10, perfect bloody characterisation of this Loki from this point in time. We already know it's wrong, we've heard him whine after getting his clothes burnt off. This is the most put together and competent he's sounded so far this episode. Perhaps he's reassured by the the thought that he might still have his magic to fall back on.

- ""I'd like to go home now."" What, Asgard? Really? So he's thinking he'd rather be there at this point, getting an Odinlecture, instead of here? I think he doesn't _need_ to _see_ paperweight Infinity Stones to know he's in over his head here, it's just that he doesn't want to admit it to himself.

- and here we are, the reveal that Loki's brain has been working on multiple fronts - he's figured out that the Avengers have been meddling with time, but his massive ego won't let him consider that there might be a worse power for the Avengers to fight off. Also, he looks even kinda proud here, the idea that the Avengers had to resort to fucking with the timeline to deal with him probably gives him a warm fuzzy feeling.

- Mobius hurries in just after this and sits at the back with his file on Loki.

- Loki apparently figured it out because Tony wears too much fucking Axe as per Ant-Man in _Endgame_. What the fuck lol. Dude has either a super nose or he's just making fun of Tony, cause I'm pretty sure he saw Ant-Man push the briefcase back (which gives him super eyes... I dunno.)

- Loki asking for a team to find the Avengers and bring them back reminds me of Prime Loki's deal with Thanos for the Space Stone, and then the ""pledge undying loyalty before backstabbing"" plot he tried in _Infinity War_. I wonder if the ""team"" request helped Mobius' decision to try and recruit this Loki.

- B-15 doesn't like being referred to as ""resources"" lmao

- Lmao, he winks at the Judge on 'gods to gods'. Is this the Loki equivalent of complaining to the manager?

- I note a few extra people in the courtroom beside Mobius. ""Hey, did you hear? A Loki variant's being trialled today."" ""You mean like that one out there killing our guys? Fuck me, I gotta see this...""

- ""Guilty... of this."" Score swells ominously, oh shit...

- ...aaaand nada, lol. It seems like he's trying to create a telekinetic blast like Loki Prime did back on Asgard in _The Dark World_. Look, I'm not sure how magic works in this universe, but my first thought was, how does such a perceived strong magic user not know internally that his magic is unavailable in this dimension? Perhaps it's like the Infinity Stones - they look exactly the same and glow and everything, but don't work at all at the TVA. So Loki has his magic, kept that under his hat till the last, most unexpected moment - but whatever dimension the TVA is in is not conducive to magic at all. Conversely, this means that the Stones and Loki's magic will probably work normally outside the TVA.

- B-15, the field agent in the room, has to explain to the Judge that Loki is trying to use magic, that's how little magic matters here. Everyone else just sniggers because Loki looks fucking ridiculous, they don't associate the action with power in any way. Very cool.

- Loki loses his cool after the Judge loses patience with his bullshit and sentences him to be reset. ""You will not dictate how my story ends!"" Fuck, that's pretty fucking meta.

- ""And who are you?"" Now, if that isn't the start of a beautiful bromance, I don't know what is.

- As Loki and Mobius walk out of the courtroom without Loki's Hunter babysitter, ""SYF"" is printed on the wall. We see this abbreviation next to a button in the elevator in the next scene, it's the top floor. No idea what it stands for.

- Beautiful shot of the wider TVA. Place is fucking massive. Don't see any kind of weather, it seems like a bustling metropolis. I assume they're in a similar building to the ones outside. Score slaps here, back to that beautiful theremin. Wonder if this is the inside of the alleged city that we might have seen for a split second in _Ant-Man and the Wasp_.

- surely Loki has seen cities built without any magic before? Maybe he hasn't seen this architectural style before in the absence of magic? It does seem a little physics-bending. Sakarr seemed pretty rationally built, besides the massive trash wormholes. Also, ""That's not real."" Yeah, it's CGI, mate 😉

- Mobius just takes everything this fucker says in his stride. You wanna set fire to everything? Fuck, do my desk first! And this place is just stuffed full of paperwork, so it'll burn nicely for ya, champ!

- So, there's a nightmare department at the TVA. What the hell. Do the TVA police dreams too? That is twisted as fuck. Does this have comics precedent?

- haha, the elevator music is Schubert, from that eyeball scene in _Avengers_! Very cool.

- Agent Mobius M. Mobius, Owen Wilson's character, finally introduces himself in the elevator as ""Agent Mobius"". (We don't know his full name in-story just yet, though.)  Like I said before, it's a weird-ass name that I wouldn't be surprised was a pseudonym. I know his name is straight from the comics, but I wonder if there'll be an in-universe explanation for it. Is his middle name also Mobius lol? Anyway, 'Mobius' ostensibly comes from the Mobius strip, a circular one-sided construct. Contains a twist, inherent in its design. (Probably more to Mobius than meets the eye, then!) Interestingly, cassette tapes, which seem to form the basis of the holoprojector in the Time Theatre, can contain a Mobius strip as a way of doubling recording area. (Facilitating Loki adding more to his life's story?) Could also be some kind of code name.

- ""I thought you didn't like to talk."" This show has basically been pure exposition for the last twenty minutes, but it's been handled so well with Hiddleston's Loki ""What the fuck is this shit???"" Laufeyson. I think the humour and the freshness of the setting really make the time fly by. Watching this still-a-egotistical-dickhead Loki have all the shit he's taken for granted ripped away from him is perversely captivating. Also, the above quote tells us that Mobius might be nice but he's also a clever fucker who might actually know what he's getting into with Loki.

- and into Time Theatre 25, where Loki will get to  do a ~~MCU~~ Sacred Timeline rewatch! That's all kinds of meta.

- I have to say, I love the next scenes. It's so philosophical, like nothing I've seen before in the MCU outside of Bucky's therapy sessions.

- ""There's only one person you can trust."" ""Yourself? I like it. Slap it on a t-shirt!"" Mobius is literally gonna show this dude a version of himself in the future - trust away, Loki. Odds are you're not gonna like what you see. 

- ""You've always lived within your set path."" Well, shit. Implication of no real free will in the MCU. An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

- I like the quickdraw from Mobius and the little cowboy riff that plays in the score when Mobius uses the time twister on Loki before he attacks. Cute

- haha, Loki actually points at the only other chair in the room, fucking requesting permission to sit down. It's probably physical sarcasm. ""Alright if I sit here then, your Worship? Won't rewind me, will ya?""

marvelstudios,Where is this push and insistence that MCU is wrong and T'Challa should be recast coming from?,"I keep seeing this push to recast T'challa and this anger surrounding the issue. To me it seemed like a pretty open and shut case. Out of respect for the real human being that played this character who just died, the character should not be recast and the story, if we insist on continuing it, should readjust it self in a way that not treat Chadwick's death flippantly. 


Even if you couldn't care less about Chadwick's death and how strange the optics would be for Disney and MCU to just be like ""Oh he's dead, all well, just recast some other black man to play his role""

There are still some other pragmatic issues with dealing with other people working on the film. Actors typically form close bonds with their cast mates, recasting T'Challa would piss off Lupita, Letitia, Angela, Daniel etc. 

Martin Freeman even said himself after Chadwick died he expected the Black Panther franchise to die along with him in the MCU.

So now what, recast and have bad blood and moral on set or recast the entire cast?

The logistics just don't make any sense. You can remove all sentimentality and still recasting T'Challa falls apart, it's not a good idea for a multitude of reasons.",1623773568,o0i0jj

The scene where he sees what happens to him in the future, how his actions lead to his mother's death, how Odin did love him after all. Tom nails the scene with his expressions. I keep watching that scene in awe of him.

marvelstudios,We’re puttin’ a team together,"We’re putting’ a team together

Loki has been with the TVA for some amount of time, enough to be familiar with the organizational structure, the employees, and the layout of the campus.  He walks freely with Morbius as they prepare for the next mission. 

Mobius: “Oh, Loki, I’ve been meaning to tell you….that whole ‘little solace to a dead man’ comment.  You know, when you first got here…your greatest hits reel?  Yeah…he’s not actually dead.” 

[Mobius keeps walking, Loki pauses for the slightest moment, falls behind, quickens his pace to catch up.]

Loki: “That’s not possible.  I think I know when I run someone completely through.” 

[Mobius stops, turns to Loki.]

Mobius: “Really?  After everything you’ve seen, everywhere we’ve gone, every TIME we’ve been…THAT’s your response?  I thought you’d know better by now.” 

[Loki stares at him, looking for the joke, debating the truth of it.]

Loki: “so you’re saying that, not only is he alive, but NONE of the Avengers know?  SHIELD doesn’t know?  How does that fit with the ‘sacred timeline’ ?” 

Mobius: “We needed the Avengers to THINK he was dead.  To bring them together.  The Time Keepers dictated that it would happen that way.” 

Loki: “So, what? Does he work here now?  Is he locked away in a box?  Did you ship him off to a tropical island for early retirement?” 

[Mobius flashes a look of surprise.]

Mobius: “Its weird how close you were on that last part…I mean…nevermind.  Anyway, the important part is that he’s doing exactly what he’s supposed to be doing, and it was all part of the plan.” 

Loki: “If there is one thing I have learned, especially since landing here, its that humans are unpredictable.”

Mobius: “Well, you couldn’t be more right about that, even with the sacred timeline in place, the unpredictable nature of people is the whole reason we exist.” 

Loki: “People die every day, and no one in Midgard is spurred to action. How could you possibly have known that would have your desired result?” 

[Mobius looks at Loki with pity in that “oh you poor thing, you still don’t get it” sort of way.]

Mobius: “with the right resources in the right places, we could push the sacred timeline exactly where we, rather, where the Time Keepers, want it to go.  We could even, say….guide the Avengers all the way through that little skirmish with Thanos…” 

[cut to a young Nick Fury, his eye freshly scratched, sitting at a bar with a young Coulson, both reflecting on the hell they’ve just been through. In walks Mobius, looking exactly as he does now. ]

Mobius: “Can I buy you fellas a drink?”  [motions to the bartender]; “I’ll have what they’re having.” 

Coulson: “Sir, we’re really not in the mood for-“ 

Mobius: “I can be quick, promise.” 

Fury: “What he meant to say was get the f-“

marvelstudios,"Listening to old interviews is wild, and tonnes of fun!","I'm a regular listener of the Empire podcast, I recently decided to pay for their ""spoiler special"" podcast as I wanted to hear their more in-depth discussion on the first episode of Loki.

There's 10 years of content here so I went way back to listen to their interviews with Feige and various writers/directors of MCU movies. Knowing everything we know now, it's WILD to listen to.

I was listening to their episode on the first Avenger's movie, and the podcast hosts are saying like *""Oh it's so interesting to see where Captain America will go after this, Stark is back in California, Thor has gone back to Asgard, but Cap can't exactly go back in time to live out his happy-ever-after"",* cut to Feige like ""Ha ha ha, no, no he cannot...""

There was also a comment about the introduction of Thanos and *""So can we expect to see a $300 milliion dollar movie of Infinity War in the future?"",* I think you could hear Feige's palpitations at that point!

Of course I doubt they had things planned that solidly at the time of this interview but it's so much fun hearing it now, knowing what we know.

Not just that particular interview, the speculation of Guardians of the Galaxy being such a risk and would it pay off, wondering how Thanos will play out etc.

If you have some free time I strongly recommend finding old interviews, even ones on YouTube and giving them a listen. What a wild ride we've been on with the MCU!",1623766017,o0f77g
marvelstudios,Ancient One and a Misconception About Time Travel,"There's this misconception that the Ancient One says that removing an Infinity Stone from a timeline creates a branched reality, a timeline without an Infinity Stone would collapse, and that returning the stones would essentially prune that timeline. I get it, the film's wording is somewhat confusing here, but I don't think this is how time travel works.

Firstly, just by changing anything in the past, you would create a branched timeline. Removing an Infinity Stone is just an example of changing something in the past to create a new timeline, you don't have to remove a Stone to do so.

Secondly, a timeline without an Infinity Stone wouldn't collapse, at least not just because its Stone-less. What the Ancient One actually implies is that there are other threats throughout the multiverse, and that removing a Stone leaves the Stone-less timeline vulnerable to attacks. A timeline without a Time Stone will function just fine, it's just that Dormammu will take over the Earth.

Finally, I don't think that returning the Stones pruned the timelines. It just makes it so that the new timeline always has a Stone to defend itself with. Granted, the wording here is a bit ambiguous with Steve saying ""clip all the branches"", but you can argue that he's just removing the possibility that the alternate timelines become overrun by multiversal threats.",1623765863,o0f56q

If I made a Hulk movie, I would mix two of my ideas into one movie. A Incredible Hulk sequel set during the time skip. The story would mostly deal about Banner and Hulk, and their struggles and distrust against each other. General Ross, Betty Ross and The Leader would come back for the sequel. Amadeus Cho would make his debut in this movie, and at the end he becomes a Hulk too. I would see this movie as a pass the torch between Banner and Cho. Banner and Hulk becomes Smart Hulk, and Cho becomes the new main Hulk of the MCU.

marvelstudios,I have a dumb theory,[deleted],1623759369,o0cyxa
marvelstudios,A theory about the TVA,"So other people have come up with a theory that the TVA, in short, is fake. Here’s some things that may support the theory 
• We see the infinity stones in Casey’s desk draw in the episode. We are told there are several of them, presumably from different variants seeing as there’s more than one of each stone, and some people even use them as paper weights. This is basically saying “These infinity stones are useless here.” That’s what you think right? Well maybe that’s not the truth. Maybe the infinity stones we see are actually fake. Think about it. There are multiple of the same stones, which have a logical explanation, which is that they are just from different variants. But at the same time, it would also make sense if they were just fake. That’s as logical as an explanation as them being confiscated from different variants. You might be going “well what about the tesseract? It’s useless there too so doesn’t that mean it’s true? Well maybe the tesseract they gave loki was fake. This would explain why he couldn’t use it.
• Well how come he can’t use his powers? Well it’s kinda simple. We see that when he attempts to use his power he’s wearing his collar. So maybe this collar also prevents power usage. I mean, this place has insane technology and the type of people they are probably arresting… would most likely be better off with a collar that makes them unable to use their powers. 
• In summary there’s a pattern here: all of these things are leading a person to believe they are powerless. I mean, if someone tells you these things are useless in this place your likely just gonna not even try to use them. You’ve been told they are useless and you’ve seen first hand that they are. This is important. They are basically making you feel like you can’t do anything, so don’t try to. This is smart. And something important but small in the first episode is what Loki says. He makes a comment about everything being an illusion… and it is. Let me know what you think!",1623759212,o0cx6t
marvelstudios,A really good companion show to watch alongside Loki: Stephen King's 11.22.63,"I've been meaning to watch the show for awhile as I love the book, and it's said to be one of King's better film adaptations. Well Loki got me in a timey-wimey mood and I booted up the first episode tonight and all I can say is wow.

I won't spoil anything, but if you watch through the loose lense of Franco's character being a variant and the TVA being a bit less, er, direct, it makes both shows much more entertaining. Give it a shot! Another fun one is a mediocre Matt Damon flick called The Adjustment Bureau.

Our Variant Loki was tasked to help the TVA find a variant of himself, but what if the twist here is the TVA being the real “villain,” they are totalitarian figures who will take any measures to “protect” their sacred timeline. Loki will find out through the other variant Loki that they are in fact not resetting the timeline but in fact just destroying divergent ones and is trying to save hers. The detonators are the result for the destruction we see in the scenes from the trailers, not an alternate timeline being reset, but completely destroyed.",1623742294,o08m1t
marvelstudios,Soul Stone Theory,"Hi,

So it has been 3 years since Infinity War and there has been some questions on some plot decisions. One main one is why does the Soul Stone has a sacrificial requirement when none of the other stones do. 

**Here is my theory on it:** The Soul Stone itself does not require the sacrifice. It is the cliff in Vormir. Imagine the cliff as a giant, twisted vault. Anything can be placed there as long as the individual is willing to pay the transaction fee to retrieve it. 

As such, whomever was in possession of the Stone previously had realized the potential devastation it possessed and decided that Vormir was the best place to safeguard it. By doing so, anyone who wishes to use that Stone will realize the full impact of what they are attempting to do, as they would have had to sacrifice a dear soul of theirs.

marvelstudios,IMO this universe feels like there's no consequences... Which is boring,"I fully expect to get lambasted for this opinion, and that's okay.

Infinity War made me genuinely care about what happened next in the MCU. It created an interesting dynamic of ""what do we do when we lose our heroes?"" That's no easy question to answer, and dare I say one of the most interesting questions posed in the superhero movie genre since Watchmen (don't hate, I love that movie to death).

But Endgame, man... I love the movie but it created a long lasting issue that I was having a crisis with in the MCU for years prior. That there's ultimately no long lasting consequences to this universe because everyone either comes back after death, or gets replaced by Hero V2.

To give a few examples (out of the far too many I can think of): 

Iron Man. In the first three movies, love or hate the sequels, Tony feels like he goes through an emotional arc/evolution as a character. It invests me in the character and makes me care about what he'll do in the future. And then all he does the next few movies is be a douche to everyone, occasionally fight and make a few jokes before screwing off until the next team up. It feels like the evolution is completely wasted, but hey he dies in Endgame so it had a character conclusions, right? Sure. Except now Pepper and an undisclosed party a few movies from now, are taking up the mantle. So the universe still has Iron Man. Tony's dead, but Iron Man lives on. Cool.

Captain America. Glues the Avengers together and brings an old school sense of justice back to a century of moral grays and political strife. Giving a similar sacrifice as Tony when he chooses to return all the Stones to the correct timelines and says goodbye to all of his friends because he believes he deserves to be happy. It's honestly a kind of selfish decision, and frankly it made me like the character more because it showed his human side that we've only really glimpsed in the past. Then Sam becomes the next Captain America. And arguably, he's even more powerful than before. Okay. Cool, so that's yet another hero they just can't let stay dead.

Loki. This one in particular, borderline infuriates me. After turning Thor into a complete wack comedic relief (which I don't entirely hate but it is a massive change) they finally give him a reason to be unhinged and enraged. Thanos straight up murders Loki in brutal fashion, right after the two brothers had finally made some sort of amends. It gives Thor a purpose, and it makes us invested in his fight against Thanos. Then Loki lives because they screw up a timeline, and he teleports away so that Disney can give him a series and capitalize on that money train. I get it, I genuinely do get it. BUT, why? Why not just focus on another Asgardian? Introduce something new instead of just refusing to bother creating a reason to care.

There's just... So many other examples I can think of but this post is already getting a bit long in the tooth. This is to say nothing of instances like Dormammu from Dr. Strange, The Flag Smashers from FWS, the new Vision from WV (I mean Paul Bettany said his contract is done so...) There's just... God there's so much.

Look, I won't pretend to not understand how difficult it must be to link these all together and not find yourself constantly stepping on proverbial toes and creating plot holes and all that. I can forgive plot holes in a sprawling universe like this. That's just bound to happen. However, what is TOTALLY avoidable is making me feel like there is no consequences to liking certain characters. 
Love or hate it, but at least in things like Game of Thrones, The Boys, Invincible, Watchmen etc I walk away feeling like a character I love or hate could bite the bullet and not be replaced by anyone.

I can never feel that with the MCU post-Endgame.

TL;DR I'm sad, mad and disappointed in the MCU after watching the latest Loki episode. I don't expect anyone to agree with me, but I needed to say it. If only for myself.",1623724157,o03hjn

marvelstudios,What would happen if Thor dropped Mjolnir on your foot?,"I'm rewatching Age of Ultron right now, and I just watched the scene where everyone is trying to lift the hammer. Tony at one point says ""it's just physics,"" and that got me thinking about the physics of the hammer. And then I arrived at my title question: what happens if Thor drops his hammer on your foot?


How does the weight of the hammer work? Theoretically it should have infinite weight because no one can lift it, even with the aid of an Iron man glove and whatnot. It obviously doesn't crush the ground/tables/etc when Thor puts it down, but I feel like it would affect a foot differently since it's attached to a sentient person with worthiness. The only options I can see if he puts it on your foot would be either the foot is just immobilized in place, or it would absolutely crush your foot and maybe just cut it off. You can't move your foot because the foot/you are not worthy, and we are not taking Chris Evans' foot into account for the sake of discussion. 


I guess in Ragnarok he did put it on the dragon's mouth in the beginning to hold it down, and it didn't really mess up the dragon. But also that's a big dragon that's working with Surtur so I don't think it's fair to compare the integrity of its lower jaw to that of the average human foot.


I am in the camp of it just obliterating your foot and there being nothing left, but I am open to any arguments or rebuttals. If you think it would only immobilize your foot until Thor picks it up, do you think it would at least cut off the blood flow or something?",1623718931,o01tsv

marvelstudios,Crazy Loki Ending Theory!😳,"

So this show introduces the TVA-(Time Variance Authority) and how they keep the multiverse together, but this will be a shocking ending to the show. So you have everyone chilling at the TVA headquarters and everything starts to go crazy. Alarms are going off and you look at the monitors and a ton of alternate timelines are being created. And is revealed that Steve Rogers created a Nexus event by going to live his life with Peggy. Remember, Loki starts during the middle of Endgame, so thats why this wouldn’t happen until the end of the show. And they addressed that the Avengers where supposed to go on their time heist for Endgame because they would’ve return the stone and restore the timelines. But Steve going to live with Peggy had nothing to do with that and he didn’t know the consequences it would have on the multiverse. If Loki picking up the Tesseract created a Nexus event, the Steve going to live with Peggy would definitely will do the same.

Or did the time keepers not plan on hulk slamming Tony with the door at all? But if that's the case, shouldn't they have captured Bruce instead?

 Furthermore, if they were supposed to grab the tesseract then, then wouldn't the entire trip to the 70s that Tony and cap took in endgame be against the sacred timeline? Or was something else supposed to happen to stop them from getting the tesseract here?",1623691418,nzryvn
marvelstudios,Guardians Of The Galaxy Game Announced,[removed],1623690052,nzrg35
marvelstudios,"Vol. 2 of Guardians tried to one-up the humor, and it kind of made it less funny.","In a movie that has a serious plot, jokes work better when it's in contrast to the serious moment. Putting goofy against goofy, to me doesn't work as well.

Drax is a serious character with the humor pretty much coming from how serious he takes things in contrast to fairly silly stuff works. Drax turning a full goofball who actually yells ""ow my nipples"" or his overexaggerated reaction to imagining him and Mantis fucking... less funny.

Moments in the second movie, such as Drax telling Mantis why it's good to be ugly, while he's technically not being goofy, his performance kind of sells it less. It would be way funnier if I could actually buy that this warrior was genuinely trying to comfort someone by calling them ugly.

Star Lord's jokey side also works better the more he has ""cool"" moments, like the epic way he escapes prison only for it to turn out that he did it for a Walkman. Star-Lord being a loser reached peak ridiculousness when they tried to imply that his beefcake self was getting fat. And Gamora saying ""really, this one?"" when she finds him on the battlefield, even though he wasn't being silly in that scene, as if just looking at him you know he's a loser.

It's more funny to see someone who's legitimately competent make the jokes that he makes.

As for Groot, I definitely prefer adult Groot. His childlike moments are more charming when he doesn't actually look like a child, while Baby Groot is just goofy from the get-go as soon as you look at him.

Hell, seeing Peter challenge Ronin to a dance battle is much more funny since so far the scene was so dramatic with Groot's death and everything. The movie went a decent amount of time without a joke, giving the moment more payoff. In Guardians 2, the scene is barely given time to be dramatic when the joke comes out. Like the reveal that Ego killed his mother is immediately followed with him goofily changing into Michael Knight for no reason.

The first movie letting dramatic scenes play out like Peter saving Gamora with his helmet, not only improves the dramatic scenes in my opinion, but also gives the jokes more payoff.

Now I get people arguing for the second movie being better since it does have an emotional payoff, and I see why people would say the plot is better, but even then, I find the first movie's way of inserting jokes to be undoubtedly superior. The second movie just feels cheaper in terms of humor.",1623689246,nzr4xj

marvelstudios,"After fairly successfully avoiding spoilers for a few years, I’ve finally caught up on most of the mainline MCU movies (my thoughts)","Really glad I took the plunge. I was never particularly interested in the superhero genre previously but definitely felt the FOMO as the memes were coming out over the past few years. Thankfully the internet (Reddit) was actually pretty tight-lipped on specific spoilers and I’m not on other social media and don’t know many other people who are into the MCU. 

So over the last few days, I’ve watched:

Avengers

Avengers: Age of Ultron

Captain America: Civil War

Spider-Man: Homecoming 

Avengers Infinity War

Avengers: Endgame

(I had already seen Iron Man 1, Thor 1/Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy 1, Captain America and the Incredible Hulk)

So I’m still missing a few but I’m really happy with where I’m at. Overall I really enjoyed these movies. I wasn’t completely blown away by any of them but I think Spider-Man: Homecoming stands out as my favourite. 

I really enjoyed Civil War as well but I found the whole plot very frustrating; it’s the kind of conflict that could have been easily resolved with reasonable, mature communication and the whole thing felt super contrived. The action and jokes were awesome though.

It’s hard to say how hard the impact of Infinity War would have hit if I saw it at release, but the cynic in me knows Disney would never kill off a bunch of their feature characters permanently (even if they were mostly the B-tier heroes anyway). I had a feeling there would be some goofy time travel shenanigans in Endgame to correct it.

The ending to Endgame got me and my partner pretty emotional though. She was saying the whole time, “this is so unfair, everyone else gets back what they lost and Cap never got to see his wife again!” so that ending was PERFECT IMO.

RIP Tony - he was probably consistently my least favourite of the bunch, but his (redemption) story was great. He was always the most selfish and didn’t want to lose out on what he had, but as with the end of Avengers 1 he showed he could step up and act selflessly when the need was great enough.

One final nitpick: in Endgame when War Machine was supposed to return from the past with Nebula, she never returns and NO ONE mentions she never came back! Then, evil Nebula shows up and bumps into Hawkeye; Gamora kills Evil Nebula and good/present Nebula takes her place and still NO ONE ever knows/acknowledges this happened and Hawkeye doesn’t mention it.

Also the fact that in Infinity War they literally had the glove off Thanos until Quill ruined it (and yeah I know Thanos is inevitable blah blah blah it still irked me).

Overall good stuff, I’m glad I’m caught up. Will watch Far From Home next",1623686148,nzq00v

When they all first went back in time to steal the stones, they were simply going back in time, the main timeline to be exact. So wouldn't cap just be going back to that same original timeline. How would he now, not only go back in time, but also switch between alternate timelines?

Something I like about the Loki pilot is that it answered a question I’ve had for a while about the character: 

**Does he enjoy what he did?** Does he enjoy killing, does he enjoy hurting? 

This is something I’ve wondered for a while when it comes to the character. While the movies do have him confront what he did to Thor and his family, it never really had him confront what he did to Earth and  how he effectively attempted genocide. Because of that, we didn’t get a full sense as to whether or not he held regret regarding what he did in New York or to Coulson or to the people in Germany.

Here, we finally get an answer: he doesn’t enjoy having to do it, but he feels as though he has to if he wants the power and control he desires.

I love it because it’s a great way of continuing (or you could argue restarting) Loki’s arc without simply repeating the same beats as main!Loki’s arc. If main!Loki’s arc involved redeeming himself in Thor’s eyes and Asgard’s eyes, 2012!Loki’s arc can involve finding some level of redemption in the eyes of others.",1623682820,nzoqfi

marvelstudios,Anthony Mackie wanted to reference MAGA in his final speech but it got shot down.,"I'm glad it did. One, too many people already felt that him saying ""I'm a black man, carrying the stars and stripes"" was too political. 🙄  Marvel also hasn't really ever referred to real life politicians directly like that so it would just play into the narrative that MAGA folks are the real victims.

To add to that, the article also points out that:

&gt;""in the context of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Donald Trump didn't become President of the United States. This means the slogan's inclusion in Wilson's speech would only have meaning to audiences, not the people Wilson was speaking to.""

I think this is a valid point.

I am currently making my way through the MCU with my partner. It's her first time seeing them and it's so great watching her go through all the highs and lows I did back when I first saw them in cinemas. (Her favourite movie so far is Age of Ultron.)Tonight we watched Civil War and she was blown away. Cap is her favourite avenger so she was sold. Near the end we got to the scene where Tony tells Cap that the shield doesn't belong to him, that his father made it. She mentioned that she didn't remember Howard making the shield. So after the movie I brought up youtube and started to write in the search bar 'Cap picks shield' however when I had typed 'Cap picks' it auto filled the rest with 'Cap picks up Mjolnir'. Then a bunch of thumbnails come up of CAP HOLDING MJOLNIR!!!! I hit back as quickly as I could. I looked over to her but luckily she was distracted by something else as I was finding the video.

marvelstudios,How do you guys think the MCU should handle The Thing? Because I see a pattern with MCU's strongmen,"Hulk's arc in the MCU was quite divisive topic within the MCU/Marvel fandom when Endgame came out. Some liked it, but many didn't liked it at all. They wanted to see a Hulk-out moment in Endgame, they wanted to see a rematch with Hulk and Thanos and they wanted to see a Hulk who's similar to the Hulk in The Avengers(2012). People said that they transformed Hulk from a brute force of nature into a character who was there only for laughs.

Then there's Drax. In the comics he's like a space Hulk and designed to kill Thanos. He's extremely strong and not to be messed with. He even ripped Thanos' heart out with his bare hands. But in the MCU he barely gets to show his true strength and is mostly there for the comedy and jokes. He also never got the chance to get his revenge on Thanos(for killing his wife and daughter) and never even interacted with Thanos.

So to me, it looks like the MCU doesn't really know how to handle their strongmen and kinda put them aside for the jokes and comedy and doesn't let them show their immense strength. But they do let their universal powerhouses like Thor, Carol, Wanda and Strange shine in all their glory and know how to handle them.

So my question is, how do you guys see them handle Ben Grimm/The Thing. I know that Ben and Johnny always have fun banter, but Ben is more than that.

Sidenote: I do have to say that I was fine how they handled the Hulk in Endgame. I think it was a great moment when Bruce realized that only he was strong enough to survive the snap to bring everyone back. He's come a long way since that conversation with Tony in The Avengers.",1623671424,nzl0th

marvelstudios,"'Loki' - How does ""reset"" (TVA) work exactly?","Hello guys!!

*Recapitulating time travel in the MCU*

1°) We understand that the logic of tinkering with time is the same as in Dragon Ball --- as we travel to a past time, we create a new reality --- changing  only that there is no such thing as the Quantum Realm in the Dragon Ball franchise. Okay. This logic/model is evident as the 2014 Nebula of the alternate timeline is killed by the Nebula of the original timeline - 2023 - and the latter does not disappear from existence. Prof. The Hulk was to return the Gems to their respective points in time and not create any more timelines [Returning the Gems or not, there would still be different timelines; if they didn't, they would create more. Therefore, that alternative scene should not be used as arguments, only the one in the final version.], as they had already created several in Time Heist, and they could not leave those lines to the mercy of evil beings.

2°) It is explained in TVA that what the Avengers did was destined to happen --- and that, therefore, it was not a disturbance to the temporal flow. We understand, therefore, that they are not limited to being against the creation of alternative timelines --- only in ""non-destined"" cases.

In the first episode, we see that, when capturing Loki Variante, they use a kind of reset bomb in the timeline. Ok. The scene shows the effect of the bomb, but it doesn't show that timeline being totally destroyed.
The question is: How does the reset work?  Does the reset work after a certain time?

The TVA agents did this in a way that didn't affect the Avengers' time travel --- and therefore didn't cause possible paradoxes [""If the Avengers were there in the destroyed timeline and that was the same line as the Loki Variant, like did they make the other trips --- if they were erased from existence""]? That is, from a time when the Avengers had already left that line, then?

Avengers Fail on Time Heist in 2012 &gt; Loki runs away with one of the Gem of Space/Tesseract &gt; Avengers get out of that timeline &gt;ki Loki falls in the desert &gt; TVA acts, as the Avengers were destined to create other timelines and travel through time, understanding the Loki Variant. So starting FROM A SPECIFIC TIME [2012 - hour x, minute y, second z, thousandth] destroys that line. Not to mess up the time travel/timeline creations --- that were meant --- of the Avengers. In other words, they didn't erase all the events on that line, but after a certain point, preventing it from continuing to exist.

Or was that reality not destroyed and just blocked, similar to what they did with a ""Time War"" (Dr. Who), which is isolated by a ""bubble"", preventing anyone from going there?",1623661494,nzik7t

marvelstudios,An Explanation on Time Travel,"First episode of Loki is out, and it is clear some people have their feathers ruffled, mostly concerned about time travel and Loki and Cap/Peggy. This post comes as a response to the sister page.

Ok, so a lot of people don’t understand time travel, and I blame Back to the Future, which easily has the worst time travel. The most paradoxical sort of time travel is Harry Potter and Dark, which is not the MCU’s way.

You can’t time travel in the MCU, at least, you can’t in your own timeline. You don’t even really time travel; instead you hop to a different timeline at a certain point. Time isn’t linear; it’s all happening at once, so you can point at a single spot at a finished tapestry rather than wait for the spot to be woven.

Cap returns the stones back to their original placements, meaning he does not change the course of the 3ish timelines. It’s even possible in some other universe that they take our MCU’s stones, but we don’t notice because their Cap did it secretly.

Now we don’t know which Peggy this is. It could be our Peggy, in which Steve does actually time travel somehow (Harry Potter style, where the past/future isn’t changed because it was always like that), or this is a different timeline’s Peggy, in which case in every universe, every Peggy is with a different one’s Cap.

That Cap we see at the end of Endgame doesn’t even have to be ours. It could be a different timeline’s Cap that boinks our Peggy.

You have to look at it as a wide structure of timelines intersecting each other rather than our timeline causing all the trouble. If we can interact with them, they can interact with us, therefore, it is likely our timeline has been affected by other people (chiefly Steve in our concern), but we don’t notice the change, because it’s supposed to happen. So far, the rules of the TVA make sense as it’s plausible all of this was supposed to happen.

I don’t mind procedurals. But I am also wary of the show being a procedural.   I don’t want Loki to spend all his time chasing other time criminals. Obviously due to Loki's nature, Loki in any disguise would have a penchant for mischief and transgression, thus various Loki variants, be they Lady Loki, Kid Loki, Classic Loki, Teletubbie Loki,  Puppy Loki (I know the last two are not in the comics, but I like puppies), could all be good candidates for time violation.

Perhaps that's how they re-organize the sacred timeline into one and that's how they were able to create the entire TVA city that Loki thought was magic - because it is.  

They have infinity stones in drawers but I feel like it's possible that their entire ""narrative"" is like a Wizard of Oz/Man behind the curtain type deal and they have used those stones to remake reality as they saw fit. I got vibes like the Others in Lost and the Time Keepers are their Jacob. 

I feel like the Time Keepers are going to be the big bad of the series somehow but i also have a hunch that the other Loki variant is collecting all those reset charges to set off inside the TVA and try to destroy it, setting everything into madness. It's too early to tell. 

One thing I am sticking with so far is that those are definitely reality stones that the time keepers have.",1623644312,nzee8f

marvelstudios,"[SPOILERS] The ""Sacred Timeline"" introduced in the Loki does not make sense...","Hello there!

I saw Loki and I loved it! However, I have a problem with the ""Sacred Timeline"". It doesn't actually make any sense. Let me explain.

This ""Sacred Timeline"" was created after a multiversal war and the timekeepers emerged and agreed upon the proper flow of time, calling this new timeline the ""Sacred Timeline"". The show leads us to believe that the events of the current MCU as we've seen them so far, are part of the ""Sacred Timeline"".

However, there are some inconsistencies with which events are considered part of the sacred timeline. In the show, we see Agent Mobius showing Loki the events of the following movies: Avengers, Thor: TDW, Thor: Ragnarok, and Infinity War. Mobius says that ""That's the way it's supposed to happen. That's the proper flow of time"". So this leads me to believe the events of these movies (as we saw them) are part of the sacred timeline.

However, the judge (can't remember her name), says that ""What the avengers did, was supposed to happen"" in reference to the time-travelling events from Endgame. This implies that the events of Endgame are also part of the sacred timeline. This implies that the sacred timeline includes the events from the first ""Avengers"" film and the time-travelling events from ""Avengers: Endgame"", which really cannot be the case.

How is it that the sacred timeline includes the events of the Battle of New York without any time-travel interference and includes the events of the Battle of New York with the time-travel interferance from the 2023 Avengers?

I mentioned this theory to my brother and he said that, because Steve Rogers returned the Infinity Stones, he essentially ""clipped"" all the alternate branches, thereby restoring the timeline back to the sacred timeline. I initially bought this, however, I realized, there's once again a problem.

How was Steve Rogers able to live in the past with Peggy Carter? This absolutely cannot be apart of the sacred timeline, we know that Peggy got married with... someone else (I think she mentions him in a deleted scene in The Winter Solider). I don't believe that this man would have ""always been Steve Rogers"". Some movies/TV (like that one Harry Potter movie), portray the time-travel as having always occurred (in the background). However, I think this isn't the way that time travel has been established to work in the MCU. Now, the argument could be made that, the 2023 Avengers were always in the background of the first Avengers movie, however, I don't believe this is the case, because when the 2023 Avengers time travel back to 2014 (to the beginning of the first Guardians film), they literally knock Peter Quill out, which didn't happen in the original film.

All of these different timelines cannot all be sacred, since there is only one sacred timeline. So far, it seems to me the following timelines are all ""sacred"" (since the TVA did not interfere to our knowledge). The timeline that includes Peggy without Steve, the timeline that includes Peggy with Steve, the events of the first Avengers without time travellers, and the events of the first Avengers with time time travellers, etc. (This includes Guardians and Thor: TDW (the other films the 2023 Avengers time travelled to)).

I really do believe that the sacred timeline doesn't make sense the way they've explained it in the show. Was Steve allowed to stay with Peggy as long as he kept his head down and didn't meddle with affairs too much? Are there variants of Steve Rogers that got arrested for attempting to interfere throughout the years? Should Steve have been arrested in the first place for choosing to stay in the past and live with Peggy? I think he should have, I absolutely think Steve should have been hauled into the TVA, since what he does contradicts the events of the sacred timeline. What do you think?",1623638531,nzco7g

marvelstudios,"(WandaVision/MCU) Vision’s mention of the Ship of Theseus is not simply a nod to his character but to the MCU moving forward. Variants, Skrulls, Multiversal Versions of characters. Phase 4 will focus on Identity.","**TL;DR: Phase 4 will deal with Identity and how the character’s perception of themselves changes. Each character in this phase will deal with their identity changing, whether it’s Jane Foster become Thor, Loki finding out he’s a variant, or The Avengers replacing almost every founding member of their team.**

**Who are we?**

The Line in Wanda vision about the ship of Theseus (whereas if you replace every component of, let’s say, a boat, is it still the same boat? )  was a perfect way to sum up, that scene with Vision, but it also describes the MCU moving forward into phase 4.

In this scene with The two opposing Visions, Marvel tells the audience what the next phase of the program is. The Theme of Phase 4 is going to be Identity. Vision and Wanda struggle with their Idendy throughout WandaVision.

Only one episode into Loki, and that theme is very much present here as well. Loki is not even himself anymore, just a variant of a Loki.

**The multiverse of existential crisis**

The multiverse will also open up a whole new realm of Warped identity. There will be different versions of Characters from other universes.  Spiderman in the multiverse interacting with another spiderman’s enemies will blur the lines of who he is.

**The Avengers**

Another clear comparison is the Avengers themselves. The original Avengers, the original ship, if you will, is made of mostly new parts. Tony, Steve, and Natasha are gone. Thor is on his own adventures. The hulk is accepting his new identity. Sam Wilson is defining Captain America in a new way. The Avengers are almost entirely made up of people that were not there at the formation of the Avengers. They are new components on an old ship.

Identity and the character’s perception of their own identity will be the driving theme throughout phase 4.  How will Loki deal with not being the original him? How will the new avengers deal with the loss of the founding Avengers? Will the ship of Theseus sink with all these new, green planks, or will it sail better than before.",1623635758,nzbtwa

It would also logically explain the behind the scenes problem between the show and the movies.

marvelstudios,"My wife finally watched Infinity War, and words cannot describe her devastation. (Spoilers)","**POST ENDGAME UPDATE IN THE COMMENTS**

*Infinity War spoilers, obviously. I’ll try to avoid specific ones. 

My wife has had a casual love of the MCU, but had never watched them all the way through. She adores Iron Man, and Guardians of the Galaxy is one of her favorite movies ever. She has never seen Infinity War or Endgame. 

We recently decided to watch all of the MCU chronologically. It’s been a long journey, but we finally watched Infinity War tonight. I have no clue how she dodged IW spoilers all these years, but she actually went into this film mostly blind. 

From the start of the film, with several beloved characters meeting their demise on the Asgardian ship, my wife looked at me and said “I don’t like this film.” All I could do was tell her to buckle up. 

I could see her expression darkening as Thanos and his crew won fight after fight as the movie progressed. 

But the real pain came with The Snap. As she watched her favorite characters disintegrate, my wife began to tear up, to cry, and then to sob uncontrollably. 

I had to hold her hand for the last 20 minutes of the film. 

And now she is using a couch pillow as a punching bag while ranting about how much she hates Thanos. Send help.

But the Fantastic Four movies, while not great, were successful, at least the Tim Story ones were. And they featured four major superhero characters. 

The X-Men were arguably pulling this off from the very beginning, I mean, their first movie had Cyclops, Wolverine, Professor X, Jean Grey, Storm and Rogue as major characters with a bunch of minor mutants and three major villains and they pulled that off. At the time it was one of the movies that began the revitalization of comic book movies after the 80's and 90's. And later X-Men installments would only expand their casts.  

Yes, its neat that four of the heroes in the Avengers movies had been able to carry at least one solo movie prior to their crossover but why did anybody think a team movie couldn't be written with six characters when X Men was able to pull it off most of the time.",1623621463,nz738m

marvelstudios,Loki - Did Loki hide a_______,"Death Baton?

When Loki and Mobius enter the time theater, Mobius motions Loki into the theater with a Death Baton and sets the Baton on the table.

When Hunter S-15 interrupts and Mobius leaves, you can see both of his hands.  It does not appear that he carried he Death Baton with him or attached it to his suit.  Mobius follows S-15 and they have a loud disagreement in the hall outside of the time theater.  Again, Mobius does not have the Baton in either hand and it it not attached to his suit.

When Loki zaps himself back into the time theater, I cannot see the Baton on the table.  (Could have missed it.) Certainly, Loki doesn’t grab a Baton from the table or even look for it to use against S-15 when they fight, not even to use as an ordinary club.

When Mobius returns, he is very prominently wielding an activated Death Baton in his left hand.

So, maybe better eyes can solve this.  

Did Mobius take the Baton with him when he left the room?  Are we to presume that Loki took and hid the Baton?  Is this just a continuity error?",1623620267,nz6o1k

marvelstudios,Karen Page,"Asking this cause I’m just curious….

I’ve been watching the daredevil series for the first time (almost finished with season two) and I just hate Karen lol. I find her very annoying and extremely reckless in her decisions/morals. They always go back and forth and idk just something about her character and the actions she makes, make me so annoyed with her. I don’t love how involved she is with the more lawyer stuff because she acts as though she’s one too but then half the times gets herself more in trouble/involved with bad things. Plus she got that reporter guy killed and hasn’t said anything (and idk if that ever comes back up, don’t spoil it if it does lol) 

Does anyone else not like her? I wasn’t sure if it was just me lmao.",1623605524,nz1fx9
marvelstudios,My theory on how the TVA operates [Loki],"Considering the question of, why is Loki arrested for time violations but the avengers aren’t? 

It’s established in endgame that time travel creates multiple timelines, so when you travel in time what you’re really doing is jumping over to a neighboring timeline.

So time can really be thought of as a series of parallel infinite timelines, the TVAs goal is to keep these timelines *similar*, because if any of them varies too much, then it splits totally, and you have a potential timeline war. 

So why did the avengers get away with their time heist? Simple, they cleaned up after themselves. It’s ok under the TVAs rules to visit a neighboring timeline, even borrow stuff from it, so long as you follow “leave no trace” rules, like camping. 

Loki on the other hand would never willingly return to SHEILD captivity, so he’s the criminal even though it wasn’t his time machine that created the potential divergence. 

This also means that cap, lining in the “dance with Peggy” timeline is permitted, since who cares. but the TVA would have strong words with him if he ever attempted to affect world affairs (I remember this being a criticism of his actions at the end of endgame “so he just lets shield be taken over by hydra?”) 

The TVA can roll back divergent timelines, but cannot roll back Loki’s escape, since that also erases the avengers trip to 1960, which is canon. 

Anyway I know this is probably full of holes since all time travel stories are but it’s fun to pick at.",1623604740,nz15t6
marvelstudios,Some Infinity War/Loki continuity that could use some explaining,"So in Loki we discover that there is 1 timeline, any deviation from this causes the the TVA to come get rid of the variant and reset the timeline so there is no multi-verse because of this

marvelstudios,It's very possible Variant Loki will have more screen time than Prime Loki by the end of the season.,"Wandavision and Falcon both had total run-times that were roughly four and a half hours, so it's a reasonable assumption that Loki will come in at around the same. Thor 2 and 3 (the movies that Variant Loki weren't in) have a combined runtime of four hours and two minutes (+ a handful of minutes at the start of Infinity War), so Prime Loki is already at a deficit. Then you factor in that Loki probably has a greater percentage of screen time in a show where he's the MC instead of a movie where he's a side character, and it's hard to imagine that Prime Loki stays on top by the end of the season.

Does this mean he will go on “knowing” there were two Tony starks present that day? 

Would that knowledge change his eventual fate?

That and the three of them tackle their respective themes nicely and have more on their mind than bringing the comics to life or setting up the rest of MCU. In fact you can watch all of them with no knowledge of the others and you’re all set. I love the inter-connectedness of the MCU but it’s great when they can stand on their own.

marvelstudios,The TVA and how to relates to Steve Rogers,"I proposed this theory a while back that Steve lived out his life in the MAIN timeline (not a branched timeline) and got shot down harshly because there was ""no way I could possibly be right"".

Now with the revelation of the TVA, I'm here to re-defend my point again.

After the events of Endgame, our Steve Rogers stays and lives his life with Peggy (this much is certain) but I proposed that it was in the MAIN Timeline (now referred to as the ""Sacred Timeline"" by the TVA).  

He did NOT live it out in a split time-branch, nor did he use his time-travel GPS locator to return to the present  (proven simply because he didnt return to the platform.) -- no, he lived his life out in the main timeline, while another version of him was frozen in ice for the most part, and then fought in all the battles, etc.   Old Steve just sat by and watched.

And here's how I feed that theory, now knowing how the TVA operates and the Time Keepers opinion of what is 'supposed' to happen. 

According to the TVA (as we are TOLD) the Avengers were meant to time-travel and the whole time-heist thing was (apparently) supposed to happen.  Thus, that event and those actions were woven into the Sacred Timeline by the Time Keepers.  (similar to how we see other branches in the animated lesson).  

My theory is that Steve and Peggy were always ""meant to be"".  And it was Steve opting to stay with Peggy in 1949 that resolved that ""destiny"".  While such an action might have typically (and otherwise) caused another branch, the Time Keepers either wove that back into the ""Sacred Timeline"" or they allowed the ""Variant Steve"" to live his life anonymously in the Sacred Timeline until showing up with the shield (after ""prime Steve"" had left the timeline.)

Whether or not the TVA intervened and told Steve directly not to screw with fate or not, or if the fibre of his character just did so naturally is irrelevant.  -- And as for those who want to believe that was Peggy that Loki saw being hauled into the TVA, maybe it was, maybe it wasnt.  If it WAS (and I'm not saying it was), then one could merely identify it as a variant Peggy before the TVA/Time Keepers wove that thread back into the sacred timeline (albeit brief).  -- again as demonstrated by the animated ""Welcome to the TVA"" video.",1623573611,nys2de

We never see him put it back on screen and once he leaves the TWA that stone will work again. 

After endgame marvel writers said stones from other parts of the multiverse couldn’t be used outside of its own universe. However according to the TWA there is only one sacred timeline and branch realities are cut and those responsible are arrested meaning , all those infinity stones originated from the sacred timeline and would be useable the second Loki leaves the TWA.",1623572298,nyrs0g

marvelstudios,The Avengers did leave a time branch open at the end of their final battle with Thanos,"So, after watching first episode of Loki, it's revealed that the TVA did not go after the Avengers because them going back through time and reversing the Snap was supposed to happen.

For bonus points, they even returned the stones where they belonged 

The one variant that existed was Loki escaping with the Tesseract and they captured him.  Good job, all branches in time have been severed, right?

Expect 2014 Thanos came to Earth with his army, and ended up being dusted.

This means that a branch in time still exists where Thanos no longer existed past 2014, which radically changes time.  Black Widow, Vision, Gamora, and Loki(just to name a few) are never killed during Thanos' attempt to collect all the stones.  

More importantly, there was no snap.

Speaking of Gamora, she's a time displaced version.  Is that fine with the Sacred Timeline?

Does the Sacred Timeline still have more branches to cut off that we don't know about that's related to the Avengers playing with time?

Could this branch be where the Variant hails from?",1623553934,nyngwm

How does *no one* except Loki (and future Stark) see the tesseract briefcase slide away when the Antman kicks it??

Finally, take a look at 1:57 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C22_LcSFIsI). The soldiers guarding Loki are staring into empty space or something like video game characters, while Hulk is scaring away the civilians on the opposite side. The person who was demanding the briefcase (Alexander Pierce) in the first place didn't even see the thing just slide away.

I know Dr. Strange is confirmed, but in his movie ""multiverse"" seemed to refer more to different planes of existence (Mirror Dimension, Dark Dimension, Astral Plane, etc) than a more traditional parallel universe model. We know that branch timelines exist, but they only seem to be created through time travel, and they seem to get clipped by the TVA pretty quickly. There is no evidence that parallel universes exist in the MCU.

While it is possible to have both, I’d prefer they just choose one and stick to it. I think having both branching timelines and parallel universes on top of pocket dimensions like the Quantum Realm would be overly convoluted and confusing. And I just like the branching timelines explanation better.

So what does everyone think? Will the multiverse in Loki be the same multiverse we see in Doctor Strange 2 and possibly future films like Quantumania? Or will it be something different altogether?",1623545528,nyl33v

The second time, in frustration, when speaking to Mobius on the stairs about the Timekeepers.

The third time, in quiet desperation, when speaking to Mobius in the Time Theater, as the reality of his situation began to sink in.

marvelstudios,Theory about Hulk's next arc in the MCU,"With the recent casting of Titania in the She-Hulk series, I've been reminded that Ruffalo's next appearance will likely be in that show, and I'm curious to know what his next arc might be. 

I'm one of a handful of people who haven't liked the direction taken with him in Infinity War and Engame. While it makes sense and connected Banner to the plot, I missed seeing the monster come out, and don't feel like Hulk has gotten a chance to show him being ""the strongest there is"". I think this is becoming an increasingly popular opinion from Hulk fans, but I also think Marvel likely has plans for Hulk to address this.

We know that Marvel (at least as of the last major update) can't make a solo Hulk movie unless they want Universal to distribute it. However, they can use Hulk in team up movies.  We know Marvel takes a lot of arcs from the comics and merges them together into a new arc. Planet Hulk was loosely adapted by Ragnarok, while at the same time covering Odin's death and Hela's resurgence. We also know that Marvel has announced movies that include characters from both if its previous D+ shows: Dr Strange 2 for Wanda, and Cap 4 for Sam. 

Here's the theory: Hulk's next appearance will be as the villain in the next team up movie Avengers 4: Future Imperfect, which will be set up by some of the D+ shows, but also can tie into Antman 3 or Engame for audiences who haven't seen the D+ series. 

While I'm not sure where Loki will go, I'd put my money on the TVA and their mission either being done away with or rendered obsolete at the end of Loki. The end of the show could set up Kang or other characters from the future, who have a bone to pick with the Avengers for their actions in the current timeline, and the TVA might be unable to stop their interference. 

So where does Hulk fit in? In She-hulk, I theorize that we will see Jen and Bruce (in flashbacks) prior to the events of Endgame, and Jen will help with the process of merging Banner and Hulk. We may also see more of Banner navigating life as the Smart Hulk. The theory is that we'll also see signs that Smart Hulk is not completely fine, and there are some lingering issues from the merge. 

Then, in Antman 3, Kang will be introduced. He has opened a rift from the future, explaining that the Avengers have ruined the future through meddling with time. Their fight with Thanos actually created another villain, who is successful at bringing the earth to its knees. Antman will stong Kang, but see signs that he's right. And here's where the theory pays off:

Avengers 4 will see an evil Hulk (the Maestro) use the tear in time from Kang to revisit the past. When Hulk and Banner 'merged' psyches, they instead created a third psyche (this is similar to Professor Hulk's story in the comics), which will slowly evolve into Maestro due to the surge of Gamma energy from his snap. Maestro is an incredibly smart Hulk with no morals and all of Hulk's power, who can convincingly fight most of the Avengers team, and has a plan to remove any of them that he might struggle with (Dr. Strange/Wanda). In order to stop him, Hulk either dies (so future him never conquers the world) or has to decide to unmerge, once again giving up the happiness Banner has earned to go back to a state of Hulk and Banner sharing control, allowing Marvel to continue his story. 

 In this way, Marvel can circumvent the ""no Hulk solo movie"" requirement from Marvel, while also telling a story that uses comic history in a new way, and provides additional connective tissue for the previous movies. What does everybody think? Would you be in favor of seeing Hulk as the villain?

TLDR; Hulk will show up as the Maestro in Avengers 4, a side effect of the Avengers using time travel to get the stones for Hulk to un-snap.",1623534552,nyhji7
marvelstudios,Do you think Loki would mess up SPOILER out of good or bad will?,"It was established that if Time Variant went off course from pre-determined fate by Time Keepers, it would creates many multiverse which results in another multiversal war.

So in order for films like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to happens, I think Loki would have to do something that results in nexus stuff or creates multiverse situations.

But the question is would he do it out of good will or bad will?

Here's 2 possible scenarios

* Bad Will- Loki finally got his hand on TVA and abuse the powers too many times which results in creating Multiverse madness.

* Good Will- Loki learns his evil variant is actually good guy the entire time and TVA are bad guys and it's run by none other than Kang the Conqueror who fabricated about Time Keepers as he wanted the sacred timeline to be his idealized timeline. In order to prevent Kang from getting what he want, Loki was forced to creates multiverse madness to mess up Kang's plan even though it's result in consequence.

marvelstudios,The long-term plan and Loki's place in it (spoilers for comic storylines),"tldr: I think they're going to do Secret Wars with Loki replacing Doom.

I think Loki is going to be the central figure of MCU Secret Wars.  Placing Doom at the center in the comics made sense not just in terms of plot, but in that grand meta symbolism of Marvel's ultimate villain, *the* classic supervillain, being the savior of the Multiverse.  But for the MCU, bringing in Doom within the next few years won't give him the same gravitas for Secret Wars just a few years down the road.  

But Loki will have that gravitas for the MCU.  In the current TV show, Loki becomes very familiar with the multiverse and how it works.  He (temporarily?) gives up on his dreams of domination, and instead starts being more of a multiversal nomad, meeting a wide variety of characters and learning new skills/powers (as he cameos all over the MCU in the coming years).  As the storyline climaxes, Loki will be positioned the way Doom was at the end of the Secret Wars build, off to the side of the main Avengers story but the only one with the powers and skills to save the Multiverse.  And then the next Endgame-level event centers around the MCU's most iconic and long-running villain.",1623532090,nygmaw
marvelstudios,Points to Ponder AFTER Watching Loki - Episode 1,"Hi, this is my first ever reddit post. I read the rules by MarvelStudios, and I still don't know if this'll be posted. 

**SPOILER ALERT**!!! Very little details of Loki episode 1 was referenced here, but it basically analyzed their rules on time travel. I would also mention other MCU movies here, and if you haven't watched them (why wouldn't you?!!!), please watch them and then go back here. Cherio

As what we've all known, if an infinity stone is taken to another timeline from its home reality, it then creates another branched reality. Such happenings is only done when - in this case - a person from the main timeline ""deliberately escapes in said timeline"".

Questions:

1. Why is **Loki** the one that is sought for, and not the **Avengers**?
2. In regards to Steve Rogers' return as Old Man Cap, the opinions of Markus and McFeely, and the Russo Brothers do not coincide. Does it prove that there was the old man Cap is in a different reality?

My thoughts:

1. The very moment that a person brought a stone to travel through time would automatically create a branched reality that would slowly become a timeline that would completely divert away from the main timeline. The further it is, the less likely the reality can be sorted out. (*If you're an unlucky lad who found your way to the time stone, and used it to correct your ways just to prevent yourself from humiliating yourself in front of your elementary crush, congratulations my friend - you'll serve in the TVA.)* However, the Avengers were given the exception rule by the Time Keepers. Why, you may ask? **It was supposed to happen**, they said...... But still, why? How? Is it just really allowed by the Timekeepers? Does their method of time travel stick to the main timeline ONLY? The Avengers' method of time travel is still full of loopholes. They created branched realities the moment they stole the stones, which at that moment produced at least 3 new branched realities - that still exists BEFORE returning the stones. Following the rules: The separate teams travel suit to the main timeline (Team Iron Man, Team Thor, and Team Blackwidow), although with differing ""time destinations"". But, moving forward AFTER taking the stones, they should travel in different timelines, each with different outcomes (stealing an Infinity Stone is a huge deviation to the main timeline). It's an ""**interreality**"" travel, so to speak. The reasoning behind this is that they still created a branched reality in that time period, *until the stones were perfectly returned to the way it was, since it was ""made to happen, as it should be"".* 

*But why not Loki?* For storytelling, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Steve went back in time to perfectly return the stones to where it happened (*The complexity on how it was done was never disclosed to us, but I think it's too much to handle*). After returning the stones, instead of going back to the main timeline, he decided to live his life as he should be by going back home and spend time with his beloved Peggy Carter. On what reality though? IF following the rules, Steve created a new reality in which there were two Captain Americas - one in the ice, one right beside Peggy. Although this is quite vague as there is no sufficient evidence to prove on when exactly did Steve return (either after the events of The First Avenger or before). This is still supported when Steve visited Peggy on her dementia state when she lost her memories and said ""Steve, you came back!"" 

However, some contradictions would say that there has been two instances of Steve Rogers in the same main timeline, where old man Cap married Peggy Carter, had two children, and was theorized that old man cap was on the funeral of Peggy Carter's death.

**The Horned God** is a deity for Wicca and some other neopagans. He is something of a mixture of horned deities from other religions, including Pan, **Cernunnos**, Baphomet, Janicot, Osirus and **Satan**, who’s also based on pagan gods. Part of the appeal of the Horned God is that it celebrates gods and iconography that Christianity has demonized. Another god that’s experienced this? Our dear Loki, conflated with the devil by Snorri Sturluson, the Christian who recorded Norse Mythology and rewrote it to fit a Chrisitan template.

So, I posit that this show will explore the concept of Loki as the ‘Devil’ - that his designation as an evil entity has been misrepresented or foisted upon him by others, including himself (“I am a Villain” as a line from Loki seems to set this up), when in actuality he is something more akin to an important natural force, unfairly demonized.

More on the Horned God - he represents nature, wilderness, the hunt, and the cycle of life and death. He is usually depicted as theriocephalic - which means having a beast’s head. In his case, usually a stag or ram. This symbolizes the **union of the divine with the animal**, and blurs the line between man and animal for the same purpose. He is considered a **god of dualities**: light and darkness, night and day, summer and winter, good and evil, love and hate, death and rebirth, sun and moon - hence the symbol. **The two horns symbolize this duality**. Funnily enough, Tom Hiddleston recently mentioned that the meaning of Loki’s horns would be explored in the show.  It also puts this symbol in direct conflict with Dagaz, a rune that’s literally imprinted all over the TVA. Dagaz ᛞ symbolizes Non-Duality, a thing that is itself only, Everlasting. And it looks like an Hourglass, how convenient.

To touch again on the **death and rebirth** thing - some Wiccans see him as dying on a specific date (there are various, but a popular one is Samhain) and then reborn again on the Winter Solstice. He is a god who literally dies and resurrects himself, much like the changing of seasons, though interestingly he returns for Winter, not Spring.

He is seen as mediator between the unknowable, vast supreme deity of the universe (Dryghtyn) and regular humans. He is also the consoler of the bereaved, as he is also the bridge between life and death and can give comfort to those separated by it.

He is the God of Witches and Sorcerers, and sometimes called by the name **’The Sorcerer**’.

&amp;#x200B;

[Kaunaz\/Kenaz resembles the \&lt; sign, but is actually the ancestor to our letter K](https://preview.redd.it/lie4afhicw471.png?width=2180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da968c6b5bbdef9017f8afc89fc91cab8ccbbbf2)

&amp;#x200B;

Kaunaz means 'Torch’, symbolizing 'The search for Knowledge/Creativity, and how the use of it can bring prosperity or destruction’. It is also known as the 'Loki Rune’, so of course it’d be here!

Also to note, the star Sirius was known as Lokabrenna to the Norse, or 'Loki's Torch'. As the brightest star in the sky used for navigation, this implies Loki as a guide and is a noteworthy positive and important role, especially for sailors like the Vikings.

**Othala/Odal,** which is of course an 'O’. It is sometimes mistakenly called the Odin rune, but it is not. (Odin's rune is actually the blank rune, symbolizing eternal possibility and shapeshifting, which may, in fact, also be referenced by these shifting letters).

It means heritage, legacy, ancestry, royalty. How interesting. Does this mean we’ll explore what that means to Loki? Will we see his heritage addressed, as well as his legacy?

&amp;#x200B;

This L with its back thrown out is I struggled with. It could be the Phoenician or Hebrew Lamedh -

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Phoenician Lamedh](https://preview.redd.it/louauedocw471.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb96dd7a5849b93a1866b8eddc6f72879e32512e)

&amp;#x200B;

**Lamedh,** as the tallest letter in Hebrew Alphabet, represents royalty - the King of all Kings, in fact - **The Almighty** himself. It also means ’**heart**’, as it is at the center of the alphabet. Finally, it means to ’**teach, learn or guide**’. Gaining knowledge is said to bring a person closer to God as they come to know his creation. *(This does remind me of Kaunaz and its 'search for knowledge’.)*

The name comes from its shape, which is a **shepherd’s staff**. This was used by the shepherd to guide his animals, 'teaching’ them the right way to go, or, should they fall, using the hook to lift them out of dangerous places.

However, I think it might actually be a reference to this symbol - or rather, its ancestor -

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This was a symbol made for The Blue Öyster Cult , they of “Don’t Fear the Reaper” fame. It’s called the ‘Cross of Questioning"". It briefly became famous as a 'Satanic Symbol’ in the 80s, despite being anything but. Worth mentioning since the Horned God’s symbol is also here. It is meant to symbolize questioning authority and the systems that govern men. However, it is not based on anything Satanic, but actually on the symbol for Cronus.

Cronus was a Greek Titan.

He famously overthrew and killed his father, Uranus, a Primordial Spirit, to make the Titans the dominant race of heaven. In time, his son, Zeus, would kill him. Both he and Zeus were the youngest of their sibling sets, and both became King of the Gods thereafter. MCU Loki is the youngest of his sibling set, and kinda maybe wants to be king? Ish? He says he does but he doesn’t try all that hard. He does kill his biological father, Laufey, though, and contributes to circumstances that kill Odin, his adoptive father.

But more importantly, Cronus was conflated with the Roman God Saturn.

Some differences between them - Saturn was not killed by Zeus, but exiled. He ruled Latium in peace and harmony, and presided over Saturnalia, a festival famous for role reversal, where slaves would become the masters and the masters the slaves. It also featured wild dancing, gambling, and the appointment of a King of Saturnalia, who would make ridiculous commands that must be obeyed for the express purpose of causing chaos and mischief (these might be “Sing naked!” or “throw that guy in the lake!”). It is thought the Feast of Fools and its Lord of Misrule have a relation to this celebration, if you’re fans of Disney’s *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* like I am. The King of Saturnalia was created to expressly mock the rule of one man, a backlash to the appointment of emperors over the traditional social and political networks of Rome. **It is meant to make ridiculous the notion of a single all-powerful man presiding over the fates of everyone.**

Both Saturn and Cronus are harvest gods, which is why both are usually depicted with a scythe. It’s actually from him that we get our image of **the Grim Reaper.**

And now we briefly come back to Blue Öyster Cult. The reason they chose the symbol of Cronus was because it represents his Scythe, and therefore invokes the Reaper. (He used this to castrate Uranus before killing him, by the by, fun fact, enjoy that image, and respect how I didn’t spend ten minutes trying to make an adolescent pun about Uranus and private parts).

You ever wonder why Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are named for Norse Gods (Tyr, Wodan, Thor, and Frey/Freya/Frigg), Monday and Sunday are named for celestial bodies, and then Saturday just waltzes in like how are you is this the right address for the party and then collapses drunk on your couch, having been named after a Roman Titan?

Interesting thoughts on that. We’re not sure it is named for Saturn. It might come from **Sætere**, another god of the harvest, possibly of Slavic origin. He is described as bearing a scythe and being a complicated god, both good and evil. His name means 'setter of traps, insidiator, plotter’. It is thought this name is another kenning for…yeah, you guessed it. Many think that **Loki** was conflated with Saturn and the resulting hybrid was named **Sætere.** So Saturday is in fact **Sætere's Day.** Loki has a day of the week named after him after all.

Another couple of gods who got conflated? Cronus and Chronos, God of Time. They also became the same figure, making Cronus/Saturn/Chronos the **God of Time.** Which is why all of them are depicted with Scythe and that symbol is also a symbol for Time. Someone else based on this conglomerate figure?

**Father Time.** A kindly, bearded man depicted as lording over time with a scythe in hand and an hourglass at his side. He is usually depicted at the new year by cartoonists as representing the old year, handing off the baton to **Baby New Year.** It is another symbol of **Death and Rebirth** \- the idea of something new coming out of the destruction of the old. This is also the meaning of **Ragnarök** of course.

It seems interesting that there may be a reference that links Death, Time, and Loki all together in a single symbol here. Even if I'm off about that symbol, I think it's good to know about the links all these figures have throughout history, and how they shaded each other.

Any other thoughts on these?",1623530752,nyg3dq

marvelstudios,I have a major theory about Loki...,"In short, I believe that none other than Kang the Conquerer is the true villain of the series. Now, this may sound a lot like the Mephisto theories that were all over the internet during WandaVision, but I am much more resolved in this theory than I was about any WandaVision theory. First and foremost, here's the evidence:

* The show involves time travel and alternate timelines. 
* Gugu Mbatha-Raw is playing Ravonna Renslayer who, if you read the comics or watched Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes (which I highly recommend) then you know has a major connection to Kang. 
* Jonathan Majors has been cast to play Kang as the main antagonist of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and some insiders have said that he'll debut in the role via a brief appearance in Loki. 

Now, here's my full theory. I believe that the time-keepers, the multiversal war, and the ""sacred timeline"" are all BS, and the TVA itself is a facade. The true leader is Kang, with his lover Ravonna carrying out his agenda while he watches from the shadows. His ultimate goal is to prevent the destruction of the future world he comes from by making sure the timeline stays unaltered, and he will go to extreme and even murderous lengths to do so. Loki, Agent Mobius, and everyone involved in what's going on are merely puppets in his plan.

marvelstudios,TVA's unnecessary steps in Loki (2021),"Why does the TVA even bother with trails and pleas? It doesn't seem like they're concerned with human rights or anything because they will kill variants if they simply don't cooperate before their trials anyway. I think it would be easier to simply leave the variant in the altered timeline as they reset it. They sentence Loki to be ""reset"" but wouldn't that have happened anyway if they just left him in 2012? Why create a system that leads to so many people existing without timelines, especially when most of the variants don't even know they're committing a crime. It seems like a lot less hassle to just not deal with variants at all and simply reset each diverging timeline.

marvelstudios,Theory: Kang has already conquered the multiverse once,"Here’s my foil hat theory after a few days of pondering Loki Ep 1:

The sacred timeline is bad news. It’s similar to Loki’s original motivation in Avengers in that it's anti-free will— people aren’t in control of their own destiny.

I think they’re retconning Kang the Conqueror as the TVA’s lead Time Keeper. The center Time Keeper in all the statues looks a ton like Jonathan Majors, the actor they’ve cast as Kang.

I think Kang has already conquered the multiverse once and created the sacred timeline (as shown in the Miss Minutes cartoon) and he’s trying to keep it that way.

Through this season of Loki and leading into Wanda trying to save her kids from a pruned timeline in Dr Strange 2 (and possibly with the Spiderverse in Spider-Man 3 and The Fantastic Four exploring other dimensions) the Multiverse is going to reopen beyond the TVA’s control which is how they’ll introduce the X-Men and characters like Deadpool. The next Infinity War-level event will be Kang trying to destroy the multiverses and restore the sacred timeline.

That's not the case at all. If anything it's the opposite. The fact that the TVA has so many copies of the stones means that they've had to constantly redirect branching timelines that were created because of the Infinity Stones being the source cause. It can even put emphasis on the ""one"" way to win that Doctor Strange saw, that even the TVA was putting in overtime to make sure that ""one"" way happened. There was only one fate of the Infinity Stones and everything that happened needed to happen. 

Also, those stones the TVA have don't work anymore. So it's not like they are casually using the stone's powers. I would feel like this is the obvious reaction to have but I can't be sure. Thoughts?",1623514636,nyabik

marvelstudios,Question: where does (spoilers) magic come from? (And does this mean we can connect D+ MCU and Marvel TV universe again),"So I've just finished WandaVision (I was late to the party and then feared I'd miss something by not having yet seen SM FFM and then Falcon and the Winter Soldier hype.... after watching ep 1 of Loki I decided I needed to get around to WV) 

Agatha says Wanda is using Chaos Magic and she is the Scarlet Witch. Cool beans. 

But Agatha also has the Darkhold, even if this one looks different to the one we saw with the Ghost Rider and AIDA/Madame Hydra on AOS. (Also, my interpretation is that Agatha has had her copy of the Darkhold since before her coven tried to off her, and it was that Dark Magic that made them freak out on her. So it was in her possession all that time, it can't be the same book Robbie Reyes got from Johnny Blaze. Maybe there's several incarnations of the Darkhold?)

Anyway, Agatha's magic is purple. Similar to the power from the Dark Dimension and Dormammu that we saw in Doctor Strange. 

But when AoS was doing the Ghost Rider/Darkhold story, season 2 of Agent Carter was also tapping into dark powers. Its been ages since I've seen it so I can't quite recall the details correctly, but it was an early HYDRA arm and a Heidi Lemarr type blonde actress who accidentally ended up with these powers to absorb energy, and it also had purple at the edges of her darkness. This was back in the day when the TV shows were meant to hype up the films, even if it never went both ways. I remember at the time the mentions of Dark magic and the dark dimension was hyped up as connecting to Dr Strange. 

So my questions or ponderings for discussion are: 

Are Agatha's powers from the Dark Dimension or something else? 

Does Agatha's magic and the new Darkhold mean that we might be touching on some of the unexplored consequences of plots from past shows? (In a way that will seem new to film only or casual fans but make TV fans excited about the link?) 

If red means Chaos and purple means Dark for witches, what was the blue of Agatha's coven, what is Strange's colour/magic and what about Loki and Frigga? Is this kind of magic limited to earth or universal?",1623512555,ny9ku4

So I have a theory about Black Widow’s film and I just wanted to put it out there.

Obviously Black Widow dies in Endgame. We all know that, and most of us are assuming this film takes place in the past. I don’t know that this would be the case. My theory is that at the end of the film, there will be some kind of twist where (and give me a little latitude here):

When you die on Vormir for the Soul Stone, you don’t fully die. Just like Thanos and Hawkeye wake up with the Stone in a mysterious place, so do Natasha (and Gamora, but I’m not going to worry about her for now). 

They are transported, at least spiritually, into some purgatory state where they have to prove their right to ascend to the afterlife, and the whole thing plays out as part of Nastasha’s consciousness. 

That’s why Taskmaster is the villain, and has all of the powers of the Avengers- she has to overcome the most powerful enemy to win, and her mind has constructed an enemy with all the skills of the most powerful people she knew. Not to mention, Red Guardian represents her image of her parents/father she never knew, Florence Pugh is her innocent self, and Rachel Weisz is her violent self.

Yeah, it’s pretty far fetched, but with everything I’ve seen in Wandavision and Loki, it’s possible!

and who is your favorite spidey out of the three of them? tobey-andrew-tom which one?

well I will lay down my reasons as to why I much prefer tom's spiderman and yes tom holland's spiderman is in fact my favorite out of the three if your interested in reading

reasons are:

I like the story of it and the build up and plots it contains in the story

the suits are definitely cool and I like that spiderman is more powerful than ever cuz of the technology and additional powers he gets from his suits

his peter parker is very relatable and I love it 

he may not be the most comic accurate but to me it doesn't necessarily mean he sucks instantly

I know some say he is just iron boy jr. which really hurts sometimes cuz I realize how many people actually hate on him and it's just sad in my opinion well I mean atleast it's not worse than the person who tried to reason with me that MCU captain marvel could beat goku just cuz she can breath in space HAHA

ok about the iron boy jr. well I agree that he is his sidekick but not really mentor yes sidekick a little? but ye I have no issues with that cuz it builded up one of the most emotional and favorite combo in the MCU (in my opinion) and ye I like the different peter parker he portrays and the funny yet slik and strong spiderman he portrays as well 

note: I am not saying the other spideys suck not by a long shot tobey spiderman felt so nostalgic and cool for me and yes he is the most comic accurate spidey of all I think there is no debate in that right? and andrew is the coolest spidey for me cuz the fighting scenes were sick

**In the beginning**

In a departure from the comics, Kang will be revealed to have been created by the TVA. As just another white shirt and tie TVA employee, Kang drones away in a doldrum of bureaucracy, but he dreams of freedom. , he starts to defy the ideals of his makers and hopes to create a new life free of the dictatorship of the Timekeepers. He wants to break free. He starts to question if the timekeepers are really all-knowing and all-powerful.

**The fallen one**

This is the reason for the scene with the stained glass window. This is not an illusion to Mephisto \[*shudder*\] or Loki but an allusion to the story of Kang himself, *In this story, Kang is lucifer. A being who desires free will created by an all-powerful entity that controls everything.*

But like Lucifer, Kang does not want to be controlled anymore. He wants to run his own life, but the TVA and the timekeepers won’t have that. They try to imprison him and force him into compliance. But Kang’s lust for freedom and revenge is too strong. He decides he is going to destroy everything his makers stand for. He is the devil to the Time Keepers. The being locked in a struggle to have free will. This will throw the multiverse into madness as Kang rebels against his creator like Lucifer against God.

Everyone is shocked and while the TVA agents retrieves all the stones and place the time bomb, Thanos says ""I am inevitable"". Boom. black screen. credit. End of the phase third.

marvelstudios,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Opening Titles","(Reposting this as I accidentally put it on live discussion the first time)

A couple days ago I decided to show my daughter Spider-man 2, with the rumours about certain returning actors most likely being true I thought I better introduce her to the other versions of the characters. Now it had been a few years since I had seen any of Raimi's Spider-man films, and I had forgotten how amazing those opening title sequences are. Sometime after I realised we're most likely going to get a similar type of sequence in the Multiverse of Madness.

I'm imagining something that really delves into the psychedelic effects the first film touched on, with the portals probably playing a big part. I also thought that similar to Spider-man 2 where the opening titles were used to retell the events of the first film, this one might do a similar thing in retelling the events of the first Doctor Strange film, as well as Infinity War, Endgame, and Wandavision.

I know that Danny Elfman is doing the music this time, but after I had this thought I went and listened to Micharl Giachinno's theme for Strange, and I could easily see it being used for a title sequence similar to the Spider-man ones.",1623496788,ny4j6h
marvelstudios,This is the first time we see Loki...,"with no powers, right? Even when he was locked away in Asgard, he was able to use magic inside the cell. I think it parallels Thor1 when he is stripped of his power which humbles him, similarly Loki finally gave in at the end when he realised he has no powers here and became honest about who he was. I don't expect him to suddenly turn not-deceitful, but we've never really seen him this honest about himself. 

Main timeline Loki never got this sort of character development, I feel like this isn't rewinding  his character development like many people feared it would be as it's past-Loki, but a continuation of it in different ways.

marvelstudios,Why haven't The Hulk gotten a Disney+ show yet?,"First off I just want to say how great it is that we are getting MCU tv shows with movie budgets. From now on we are gonna get 8 plus MCU content every year. How great is that. And finally the MCU can give some spotlight to the side characters of the MCU like Falcon (now Captain America), Winter Soldier, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Loki, War Machine and Hawkeye. But the one character that deserves some spotlight, that has long been ignored in the MCU is The Hulk/Bruce Banner. 


I know he is in She-Hulk, but he is only gonna be a side character in that show, yet again. The MCU has been great for Marvel fans. I can't even imagine how satisfied long time Iron Man, Captain America and Thor fans are. But if I had to guess, the one fanbase that isn't happy with what the MCU has done to a character, is Hulk fans. The Hulk is one of the most iconic comic book characters ever, up there with Batman, Superman, Spider Man and Xmen. But in the MCU, he has been nothing more than a punching bag for the other Marvel heroes and villains. 


I know Universal own the distribution rights to any Hulk-related film projects. But that's not an issue with Disney+. Marvel have a way around the problem now if the film rights didn't revert altogether. That is why Marvel can make a She-Hulk show, because Universal can't stop Marvel from making one. So that is also the cause with The Hulk. All I am saying is before Marvel announced a She-Hulk show, they should have done a Hulk show. Hawkeye is getting his own send off show and Black Widow is getting her own send off movie. Why can't the Hulk get the same treatment?


She-Hulk is the future, and The Hulk is the past. But why can't the Hulk get a last hurray before he retires from the MCU? It doesn't sit right with me that The Hulk/Bruce Banner character's last appearance might be in a She-Hulk show. The Hulk deserves his own show, not again be a side character in another Marvel property. Mark Ruffalo is a fantastic actor, and it is a shame that his talents are always wasted in the MCU. All I ask for is a solo Hulk show to finally explore his different personalities in depth.",1623489697,ny2s26
marvelstudios,Amadeus Cho - A Secret War Story,"I want to be a screenwriter but do not know how to start yet, so I decided to just publish my pitch for an MCU show here to hear any recommendation from you guys

The show would be packaged like a conventional Shonen anime live-action adaptation for an Eastern young audience market. Amadeus Cho will be a cocky character like the comic, but actually loyal to his human friends. His mathematical abilities can be used as a visual of tactical anime battles like in Shonen manga. He's the strategist in the Young Avenger team. The main theme is about self-esteem

1st Arc: Introduced as school politics drama consists of top 10 intelligently gifted students on Earth. Cho narrates how each student has their own smart way to be the 1st, but each has their own weakness. Although extrovertedly seen cocky, instead of using their weakness to defeat them to be no 1, Cho secretly helps each student overcome his weakness in a way, and he feels internal joy for doing what he really believes is the right thing to be a good human but also hoping loves from his friends. This to show his scanning ability &amp; character

One day a masked shadowy group comes and with just a swing of a member's ridiculously gigantic sword destroys the whole school, but students survive. They introduced themselves as Pythagoreans ( a nod to the comic, also a nod to a real Greek cult, read Metempsychosis too) and plan to kill Cho for a reason. Then it will be the first battle: Students vs The PTGs, which became a thriller in one episode. All students killed &amp; sacrificed themselves for Cho. Cho promises to Avenge.

End of 1st ep: The PTGs reveal to Cho that they are all Cho from various multiverses (same actors). Each has his own superpowers whereas Cho only can use his intellect. Unlike Loki variants, they look the same for a reason. Throughout the thriller chase, Cho is showing apparent self-esteem issue (Cockiness is actually a form of fake self-esteem, contrary to popular belief NPD is associated with suicidal behavior)

2nd battle: Cho attempts to battle his variants, but ended looking like his variants destroying Cho. This represents self-harm, suicidal thoughts, self-guilt.

End of 1st Arc: Young Avengers arrives to help.

2nd Arc: After some battles, a YAv defeated a Cho variant and it revealed to be a Skrull. After Secret Invasion, there's huge paranoia of Skrulls within humans. Cho's showing huge anxiety behavior &amp; YAvs attempt to help. This arc represents how a friend helps a bullied or gaslight victim. Each YAvs have their own way to help. Some help, some make it worse, slandering the Skrulls as a toxic species.

Character progression: From cocky, fake confidence, Cho tries to gain confidence in a sustainable way.

3rd Arc: Final Battle of YAvs vs Cho'vars. YAvs beginning to lose. Near Climax: Cho comes out as a Skrull. A Super Skrull who can copy 1 appearance &amp; only 1 superpower at a time. Cho is actually an alien who is obsessed to be a human. After Endgame, humans are overvalued. So he picked human as appearance &amp; 1 ability of huge intellect as it's an attribute most humans valued the most nowadays.

He can only use 1 ability when he's human. He's Hulking Out &amp; out of disguise so he can be his maximum to save his friends. This to visually message: Self-love with an attribute that might alienate you, being ourselves not hoping for love back but for what we believe is right. A Secret War within ourselves. Also as an anti-thesis of human hate

Next YAvs: Cho would be like a catfish influencer to humans like nowadays. Represent himself as a young Hulk for PR with TotallyAwesomeHulk as an online celeb name. Wiccan calls him Teddy as his nickname for a reason. Humans love him, but because of the previous events, Cho doesn't believe this is the right thing. Cho comes out as Skrull to public parallel Iron Man 1 but with a backslash.

Season 1 is about self-battle, Season 2 is about Self vs Community: Cho outta Earth to build his own kingdom. Try to make peace of Kree &amp; Skrull. Inspired by his comic adventure also WWHulk. Packaged as space GoT but with a New Testament-like message.

marvelstudios,TVA Vs Steve Rogers,"In Endgame, Steve goes back in time to return the stones in order to prevent branching timelines. However, as we see in Loki episode 1, the timeline from which the Avengers stole the Time and Mind stones was wiped out due to Loki's variance. This means he has two stones with nowhere to put them.

I posit that the TVA showed up to confiscate them. We see in Loki that they have plenty already. This would also explain how and why Steve lives to old age in the sacred timeline. He knows that he can't change anything to big without that divergence hitting the red line and becoming a separate timeline that will then just be erased. So, instead, he lives a quiet life if non-interference. This doesn't create significant change so instead of creating branches, the events are a predetermined element of the timeline that had always been a part of it.

That should fit, right?",1623487587,ny2adc

marvelstudios,Avengers' salaries (spoilers),"This is a topic of quite some confusion.

In one of the MCU movies (I think it's Spiderman 1 but not sure), Tony Stark says to someone - ""... that's below their ( the avengers') payscale.. ""
I distinctly remember this dialogue. This makes it sound as though the Avengers do have salaries. 
Also it is a full time job and they are risking their lives. They live in the compound, train hard and risk their lives to save innocents. 
If you remember, in Winter Soldier, Natasha came in a swanky car when she heard of Nick Fury's death. Wanda also drove to Westview in Wandavision. For all of them - this is their full time job so obviously it has to pay something for them to afford vehicles of their own right (Steve's motorcycle as well). 
I remember a dialogue from Steve in Avengers 1, where he says he doesn't think he can afford a place in Brooklyn. Plus in Winter Soldier, aren't Steve and Sharon's apartments provided by Shield (and bugged yes), or am I mistaken?

So it is pretty confusing to me when Sam implies in TFATWS to the bank officer that there's a lot of goodwill around being an Avenger and there's no salary (isn't that what he implied?)

But can that be true considering all the other information we have?

In the light of all that we've been shown in all of the MCU movies, what do you guys think?",1623485845,ny1vsx
marvelstudios,TVA Vs AOS,"I've always been an advocate of Agents of SHIELD still being MCU canon. I know it's official status is kinda hinky but nothing on-screen has ever directly contradicted the idea that they still occupy the same story space. Episode 1 of Loki challenged that but I think I've got it worked out.

AOS creates two branching timelines; one in season 5 and the other in season 7. We'll take them one at a time.

In Season 5, Shield is abducted and brought to a post-apocalyptic future. Shenanigans ensue, they come back, and prevent the apocalypse in the sacred timeline. This creates a significant branch timeline but here's how I see it. The Agents, like the Avengers, had to go on that time-travel excursion in order to save the day. The Time Variance Authority can travel to any point in time and any branch of the timeline and clip it, ending the universe before it reaches the red line. So my thinking is the TVA allow the journey and once the agents have what they needed from the future, the tineline is retroactively cut at the stem. It's still part of the agents pasts because, as Banner points out in Endgame, that is immutable but the universe itself is gone. No branch.

Season 7 is a bit messier because of so many time jumps but essentially the same logic applies. In the first quantum incursion they create enough of a change that the timeline branches. They keep doing this throughout the season but it's all necessary for the saviour of Earth in the sacred timeline so the TVA allow it, following on the heels of the agents, wiping out the minor branches as they leave and the main branch once they return to the sacred timeline. Unfortunately, this means Deke is erased. The two variants they bring forward though are likely treated as acceptable to the main continuity though, like variant Gamora. 

I think that fills the gaps. Thoughts?",1623485475,ny1srf

So basically the other variant of Loki (probably female Loki) is creating all these chaos because he/she  fears TVA might prune and reset him/her. So this variant Loki will eventually convince our 2012 Loki that once 2012 Loki hands over him/her to the TVA, there is a good chance they will prune 2012 Loki too considered TVA members are afraid to trust Loki. So 2012 Loki acts as if he works for the TVA but in the end betrays TVA and gets together with the other Loki (female Loki) to cause more chaos and end up creating a multiverse so the TVA would be trying to fix the various multiverses which would make it hard for the TVA to catch the Lokis.

**Post Credits Scene:**

[Wanda reading the Dark Hold](https://preview.redd.it/0j0dwnolas471.png?width=1608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37158d9e8046a97d63349b1e34d3c5c35dd36c45)

Both the Lokis are the reason why Wanda hears the twins screaming ""Mom help!!"" while reading the Dark Hold. Remember time passes differently in the TVA so they can easily go to Earth when events of WandaVision occur.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dr. Strange Multiverse of Madness:**

&amp;#x200B;

Movie starts with both the Lokis confronting Wanda and saying they can bring her twins back. Wanda will be an powerful ally to Team Loki considering she is a nexus being(being which can alter probabilities and warp reality to her will) like teased in one of WandaVision's commercials. Wanda doesn't know that creating or expanding the multiverse will destroy everything so she thinks making/expanding the multiverse wouldn't cause much harm. Dr. Strange will sure find something is wrong and the TVA contacts with him to help fix this. Mordo meanwhile tries to attack Strange and of course fails considering how powerful Strange is, when Strange can hold back Thanos in Infinity War while he has 4 stones and Strange didn't even use the Time Stone, am pretty sure Mordo is no match to Strange. Once he defeats Mordo, he explains him that a multiverse is being made and might destroy everything. Once Mordo realizes this, he sides up with Strange considering that a Multiverse will break all Laws of Nature which Mordo vowed not to break.

Spiderman may help in this too since No Way Home might involve Strange but is highly unlikely and Spiderman is useless in conflicts which involves magic.

 So Mordo teams up with Strange and Wong and TVA to take down Team Loki.

&gt;NOTE: I KNOW THAT SOME OTHER POWERFUL VILLAINS LIKE DORMAMMU OR NIGHTMARE OR EVEN THE mEphIsTo (i am certainly not beleiving mephisto is coming here) MIGHT BE THE MAIN VILLAIN BUT MOSTLY THOSE VILLAINS WILL HELP  THE LOKIS AND WANDA TO MESS UP THE SACRED TIMELINE AND CREATE A MULTIVERSE SO PLOT WON'T CHANGE MUCH.

marvelstudios,LOKI Pilot - Thoughts from an aspiring writer,"2021
JUNE 11
LOKI Premiere Editorial
‘Freelance’

“LOKI” first episode is a must-stream-ASAP television series &amp; I wouldn’t be doing this pilot any justice saying anything other than just that. Whomever did the screenplay/script is a true professional and comic book connoisseur. I myself was marveled (no pun intended) let alone perplexed with how steadfast and excellent the writing was or how it literally made it seem that somebody actually cared enough about their job, and the product - to make it 2021’s best series premiere.

It was the best series premiere out of all of their shows, period. Leaving little to nothing left to desire; Possessing real drama, real emotion, plot points open to interpretation ( which let’s face it this is something Marvel does not do ). Shockingly, there was no unnecessary over the top CGI, crummy staged violence or action that seemed incredibly forced in.

About a week prior to the refreshing pace-changing Wednesday release; Disney’s Marvel Studios head-honcho Kevin Fiege released a statement informing fans of the Cinematic Universe, that the “LOKI” mini series will indubitably have the greatest impact of all the recent content Disney+ has generated on the future of the MCU. This is something that will surely leave fans on the edge of their seats upon the consummation of the God of Mischief’s streaming on Disney+.

At first I was skeptical about particular castings but my skepticism was immediately met with acclaim. Monologues and dialogue done by Owen Wilson as Agent Mobius along with the superb acting and character portrayal by Tom Hiddleston was just fantastic and nothing less than immaculate. 

Hiddleston’s Loki is not an easy character to develop on screen, as he’s incredibly complex and diverse while seemingly struggling with emotion with intense lucidity in his character arcs. Which makes the initial scenes done with Wilson’s Mobius, a clear sign Hiddleston has elevated from bad guy you love to watch lose to the anti-hero that we can all appreciate and cheer for this summer.

When Mobius ( Wilson ) asked Loki ( Hiddleston ) “What makes LOKI tick?” I was sitting on the couch, around midnight dead tired - watching this, wide eyed like it was a PPV event, repeatedly uttering to my wife and older daughter 

“This is so good, this is amazing. I am so happy, they literally can do so much with this story, it’s just so good.”

I literally said those words. And let me make this clear - I’m a cranky, old, sleepy disabled vet whom loves to critique. Rarely am I one to say “it’s just so good” but that scene in itself, captivated me, and showed me a side of Loki - that we have yet to see in Marvels cinematic adaptations of Thor, and The Avengers. And I for one, and completely excited for some more mischief from my favorite god, every Wednesday this summer, on Disney+.

PF, SR.

TL;DR - I thought the pilot was great, near perfect in my opinion. Super excited about the rest of the season.",1623479155,ny0azw

marvelstudios,Loki Variant Theory [Spoilers],"I was trying to figure out where the ""rogue"" Loki variant fit into all of this, and it hit me

This theory relies on the assumption that those TVA reset charges function to destroy the branch points caused by nexus events. I originally thought they were just rolling back the timeline, but there must be a reason why they haven't shown us what happens when those reset charges are set off. Also, ""pruning"" of the nexus events is mentioned.

Now back to my theory, I believe this Loki variant is collecting the reset charges to prune a specific timeline. We know that the timeline can branch out further from a nexus event, so I think Loki is pruning out specific branches so that the timeline follows a specific path. 

I feel like this quote by Mobius also supports my theory.

&gt;“You weren’t born to be king, Loki. You were born to cause pain and suffering and death - that’s how it is, that’s how it was, that’s how it will be. All so that others can achieve their best versions of themselves.”

The pain and suffering and death could refer to the pruning of specific branches in the timeline. Doing that so others can achieve the best versions of themselces could refer to the creation of that specific timeline.

The TVA says Loki was never supposed to escape, but also that the Avengers were supposed to do the Time Heist, but part of that Heist goes wrong in New York and Steve and Tony have to go even further back to get the Tesseract from Pym and Howard. So now, we’ve got Loki escaping, which wasn’t part of the *Sacred Timeline* and the Avengers going back even further to replace the stone that Loki escaped with, which was supposed to happen.

marvelstudios,Free will and the TVA,"A lot of people have been saying that the TVA essentially takes away all free will and how this introduced concept is a mockery to the MCU universe and all it’s characters choices.

I coul have an incorrect understanding of course, but to me that means that all of our characters choices were their own - it’s more that the TVA ‘allowed’ those choices to be made? So the significance of Tony’s and Natalie’s choice to sacrifice themselves isn’t lost with this new understanding of the universe.",1623476128,nxzk0k
marvelstudios,I cry every time I watch endgame.,"Kinda long hella emotional but golly I can't help it.

So a little context. I am and have always been a nerd I love comics though my reading later in life is surprisingly more limited mainly due to time. My introduction to alot of these characters were their respective animated shows or throwaway movies from when Marvel was only really good at writing books. I'm 23 so I missed alot of first-hand pop culture phenomena being a late nineties baby. My first star was movie was Episode 1. So ya know my nerddom is centered around Marvel and was exclusively for most of the first half of my life. Stan Lee Jack Kirby Steve Ditko Rob Leifield Jim Lee all stand as heroes in my heart. 

With all that said. These movies. This universe. I swear I've never wanted anything more in my life. Growing up with And waiting for the proper treatment and expansion of the universe around such deeply emotionally intertwined symbols of my individualistic development was so bitter sweet. Until one faithful day, a month before my 11th birthday, I finally seen Ironman. Going into it I was expecting more elation from the sheer presence of a yet to be honored character like almost every movie experience I had up until that moment. From Spiderman 2 and X2 to Ghost Rider and Blade Trinity. I was just happy to see these characters (allbeit teasingly being from NY and never seeing any of my NY heroes together). But to not only see one of the best actualizations of a image come to life backed by a story that ultimately was more memorable after one viewing than alot of Marvel's previous efforts. It was like I was watching the memories The man and The King planted in my head when I was young come to life. Even back when the MCU was more grounded and muted it always felt like a new life to what I loved most. And for that to be the first step to an ever evolving and genre defining entity. I finally had something my mother thought was good enough to watch with me without feeling like she couldn't get invested. Something that brought life to my grandfather's childhood as well. Someone who watched all the Cap movies and Hulk movies from the last millennium as they came out. I had something good enough to talk about in school with my writing teachers and with my mentors even if they weren't longstanding needs themselves. It was almost like the world and my life gained more context from watching the things that used to get me excluded become apart of a zeitgeist I had yet to truly be apart of. It escalated my taste for movies both forward and back. I became a Star Wars Fan after being inspired to go back and see why we have this landscape at all. Now I can appreciate the Galaxy Far Far Away Palpatine being my evil wet dream. I truly am proud to see it have come so far. It has ushered in alot of cultural turning points in it's 13 years. Gave us all characters that we can invest in and cry with and love and lose all the same. And while they are of course far from perfect, there is something so uniquely present in everything they do. I've seen 100 percent of the cannon releases and about 85 % of the Machines output since it started up. Even at it's lowest points it is everything I could have hoped for and more. And knowing they are going to go out of their way to make more and more people feel seen and heard is so heartwarming. 

As a queer black kid I grew up lonely in my heart. I never knew I could even see something as great as black panther and feel present through visualisation. I only every drifted towards characters who internally I related to but it wasn't until black panther that I truly felt the weight of representation. My eyes and heart swelled seeing my people my mother my grand parents siblings cousins and friends in these characters that 10 years prior would have been played up for non black audiences or not seen at all by non black audiences. 

Every new step makes me fall more and more in love with it. Every Phase is a new layer of admiration. My faith in this universe has payed off tenfold and to see other people want for it's success makes me feel like I finally belong. 

Avengers Assemble is now my joyful tear trigger. And I hold out hope that I'll get to thank all of the actors main and supporting as well as the directors and Feige,  and D'esposito, and all the other people who have brought this to my life. Thank you for your time. This was long and I all who read can feel it's pull on me.",1623475256,nxzc1i

marvelstudios,TVA and Thanos:,"So as seen in episode one of Loki, the TVA supervises the scared timeline and apprehends the variants. In endgame, the avengers were meant to time travel, but was thanos meant to come from 2014 to 2023? 
Because thanos came to another timeline and died, the 2014 timeline now has infinity stones but no thanos which has created a different timeline altogether. 

So shouldn’t the TVA have apprehended thanos too? Why only Loki?",1623471345,nxya7i
marvelstudios,About Time Keepers? (SPOILER),"In Episode 1, TVA was created by Time Keepers in order to protect the sacred timeline since they are too busy with the timeline's flow.

But after thinking about it, What if Time Keepers weren't real to begin with and it was nothing more but fabrication created by none other than *Kang the Conqueror*?

When Loki ask Ravonna about speaking with Time Keepers, she says they are ""too busy"", was she telling the truth or was making sure nobody know about her lover? (She has a romantic relationship with Kang).

Imagine TVA's reaction when they learns that their gods was actually just a time traveling dude.

Remind me of Wizard of Oz where the great and powerful Oz was nothing more but a magician.

Do you agree or disagree that Time Keepers was made up by Kang the Conqueror and some of TVA folks may know about it.",1623470495,nxy1p3
marvelstudios,"Loki Theory - ""History is Written by the Winners"", or why you shouldn't believe everything a charming bureaucrat tells you","TL;DR - The Time Keepers are not indifferent or benevolent figures - they are self-interested, powerful figures who are intent on creating/maintaining a particular timeline in which they have that level of power and control. The TVA is a bureaucratic agency that enforces the Time Keepers authoritarian rule over what we know as the cannon MCU. 

So I have been scratching my head a bit after watching the Loki premiere. While I loved everything about the show (acting, aesthetic, writing, etc.), by introducing the Time Keepers, the ""Sacred timeline"" and the TVA, Feige and Co. have seemingly introduced a version of determinism (basically fate) as well. On the one hand, the idea of a ""sacred timeline"" solves some of the issues brought about by introducing time travel and multiverses in Endgame, but, on the other, it also introduces a potentially worse problem. When characters are fated to do certain things (be it by God, ""the stars"", or a sepia-toned opaque bureaucracy with a love for analog tech protecting a ""sacred timeline""), it robs them of any agency in their decisions that play out in the story. When it comes to superheroes, there are no stories of good triumphing over evil, simply events taking place as they were always meant to. I couldn't shake being a bit disappointed by some of these ideas and their implications for the broader MCU.

On a second viewing of the episode trying to sort through these issues in my head, the scene towards the end when Loki finally admits he doesn't enjoy hurting people suddenly read to me very differently than when I first watched it. ""I don't enjoy hurting people,"" Loki says, ""I don't enjoy it. I do it because I have to, because I've had to...because it's part of the illusion. It's the **cruel elaborate trick conjured by the weak to inspire fear.**"" This is a great moment for Loki as a character, finally expressing his vulnerabilities and shortcomings, and a great bit of acting by Hiddleston. But then Mobius responds, ""the desperate play for control,"" seemingly in confirmation, in a way that is almost...too eager. And it hit me: What if Loki has just fallen for someone else's ""cruel elaborate trick""? What if his initial instincts about how ""absurd"" the idea that TVA ""decides the fates of trillions of people across all planes of existence at the behest of three space lizards,"" was correct? 

The idea of a ""sacred timeline"" and it's deterministic rules are first laid out to Loki (and the audience) through the Ms. Minutes cartoon. With a now more skeptical lens of the TVA's motivations, this cartoon reads as a pretty effective propaganda film. It all so cleanly lays out that there was a chaotic time long ago in which the ""multiverses battl[ed] for supremacy"" that almost resulted in the destruction of reality itself, until ""the all-knowing Time Keepers...[brought] peace,"" by uniting the timelines into one ""Sacred Timeline"", and how now ""the Time Keepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything."" This all reads as classic authoritarian logic that is told to the public to justify the regime: the great lengths that those in power go to in controlling your life are actually being done for your protection. Or, in the specific case of Loki, reality will fold in on itself unless the TVA exists to keep the Sacred Timeline intact. 

As Ms. Minutes continues, she reveals perhaps a bit too much in saying that, ""sometimes people, like you, veer off the path **the Time Keepers created**"", and explains how the TVA go around ""fixing"" things big and small, (""maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work,"" as Ms. Minutes explains) as ordered by the Time Keepers. On my first viewing, this was the part that really irked me, as it basically states that the TVA could have had a hand in anything we've seen thus far in the MCU. But now, with a more skeptical eye, it reads as the authoritarian regime overstating it's level of power and influence. Have the Time Keepers actually succeeded in creating a single ""Sacred Timeline"" to bring control to the multiverse? Or have they just taken one timeline, and through the ability to alter history to a certain degree within in it, now have a level of power that they use the TVA to maintain? The final tag line of the film is, ""For All Time. Always."" Perhaps they're chest-pounding just a bit too much? 

Anyways, this is long, so I guess my remaining questions are:
*How much of the TVA knows what's going on, and how much them are just brainwashed too?
*Relatedly, is Mobius being honest about his motivations as a loyal solider for the TVA? Or is this going to be a story about Mobius using Loki as a tool to bring down the Time Keepers? 
*What exactly is the extent of the Time Keeper's and TVA's influence? Is the ""Nightmare is another department"" bit from Mobius a hint that they are still actively battling other forces (potentially worse ones?) that want to control reality?",1623470203,nxxyju
marvelstudios,[Spoilers] reporting to a 'higher up',"Is Casey reporting to the Time Keepers?

marvelstudios,"Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Wandavision all have a similar theme.","After watching the first episode of Loki, I come to realize that phase 4 is walking in with a strong message to its audience. 

Loki, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Wandavision all have a similar theme! And that is Grieving and Accepting who they are. 

Wanda, who has been through A LOT! Shows this in her show, WandaVision. Each episode has stages of grief that Wanda show's, very well written I may add. Watching the show the first time, I didn't see it but watching it the second time, we see her going through these stages in Westview. She is trying everything in her power, without even realizing it, to stay happy. She ignores the truth and everyone around her, she is very emotional, she doesn't know what's going on and she tries to hold on what she has. Its very well written and I cannot wait to see her in the future.

Bucky goes through a series of grieving as well. He has lost his best friend and only companion in the world. He is still trying to come into peace with the abuse and brainwashing he has had with Hydra. He is all alone at the beginning, trying to start his life. He is in a way, scared and confused on what to do and you see it in the show. From going on a date with the girl to his connection with the shield. But as the show progresses, we see Bucky is coming into the world. He is seeing that he has friends to lean on when he is scared, he found a home. He makes amends in a way with Zemo while also becoming part of Sam's family. 

Loki, be it the first episode, also had a similar theme. While we see clips of his life, Loki see what a monster he has become. Something he never wanted to do and we see that it hurts him. He see's the the pain that he caused, from the death of his mother to the pain he caused to innocents. In this revelations, Loki disowns what he use to be. Wanting to be a better person, and by that he tells Mobius his feelings. 

All three of these characters have gone through so much in the last three phases, and I am happy that Marvel is showing us the progression of their healing. Healing is rough, especially when your these guys, but Marvel is showing us that they are taking the steps to become better people. Personally, I think Marvel is doing a great job, and I hope that we see more of this progression for Loki in future episodes.",1623467499,nxx6or

marvelstudios,[Loki Spoilers]Question about the TVA,"What is your interpretation of the TVA’s role in the timeline?

My interpretation is that they simply monitor for variances, or differences, that create branch realities. Once found, they clip them. I don’t believe they are deciding the outcomes and fates of people, just making sure what has happened for all time keeps happening. 

Others say they are determining the fate of others by deciding what happens. I don’t see it this way. An analogy of what I believe they are doing is this: if I watch 1,000,000 copies of the Lion King, and in one of them Scar wins, I’m going to discard that variant copy. Not because I want Simba to win and enforce my will on the movie outcome, but because I’ve seen the movie so many times that it’s easy for me to spot the variant one and get rid of it",1623465632,nxwmyg

Is there more possibilities? Also, if it’s the second one, then we have yet to see the multi-verse right? Like I don’t recall anyone being in another universe unless it implies to point 1. Any ideas?",1623464755,nxwdsh
marvelstudios,"Some thoughts and considerations over the ""TVA"" in Loki.","I feel like, from looking at the MCU community's reaction to Loki that there is a bit of confusion relating to the TVA, particularly in how it concerns the rest of the greater MCU.  
For now, I am mainly going to be responding to [the ""EFAP"" podcast episode of Loki Episode 1](https://youtu.be/lMBZ-sSKw0U), since I feel that it, in part, is the source of a lot of these misconceptions I am feeling; although a part of that is due to the actual writing of the show not being careful enough in parts in portraying these new ideas.  


I am going to be going over three different points I have seen talked about online, all of which being proposed in this podcast, and I will give my thoughts on them.  


&gt;**1. That ""The TVA in the MCU prohibits free will in its entirety. Every time  anyone makes any decision that goes against the Sacred Timeline they are immediately seen as criminals, and erased. ( Or ""Melted"", as its commonly called online. ). This hurts the rest of the series through the fact that every key decision in the MCU was in fact chosen by the Timekeepers, rather then by the characters themselves.""**

I feel that this criticism comes about through a misunderstanding of episode 1, although such a misunderstanding was likely intentional on behalf of the screenwriters due to the fact that its an opinion shared by our protagonist, Loki.  


I am going to post a except from Miss Minutes introduction video at the start of episode 1, for context.  
*""Now, the timekeepers protect and preserve the proper flow of time for everyone and everything. But sometimes, people like you veer off the path the Time-Keepers created. We call those variants. Maybe you started an uprising, or were just late for work. Whatever it was, stepping off your path created a nexus event, which, left unchecked, could branch off into madness-leading into another multiversal war.*""  


I believe people are looking to this paragraph and coming to two conclusions off of it. That the TVA considers all deviations of the Sacred Timeline as criminal, and that any ""choice"" in a temporal sense creates a new timeline.  
I think the miscommunication here is that the focus of Miss Minutes video is not the creation of new timelines, or going off the path the Timekeepers created - its the creation of **Nexus Events**. A Nexus Event being something that, if left unchecked, could lead into another multiversal war.  


We can presume that Loki escaping with the Tesseract in Avengers; End Game was a Nexus Event, while other sources of time travel - such as the Avengers getting the infinity stones in Endgame and Doctor Strange's time loop in his movie are 'closed loops' and thus are not Nexus events.  


I imagine the main reason people feel this way is that Loki, the character, is of the mind that this ""is"" a infringement of all free will. I imagine we will figure out if this is the case or not over the course of the six episodes of the show, but with the evidence we have now I feel that it is relatively unlikely.  


&gt;**2.** **That ""The infinity stones in the drawer of the office worker marginalizes the events of Endgame, WandaVision and Infinity War by making the sacrifices those characters made less important.""**

The main reason people come to this conclusion is due to how important the MCU has made the Infinity Stones, and just ""having a unlimited supply of them"" creates an issue where things like Black Widow's sacrifice, the militarized White Vision in WandaVision and even Loki's death in Infinity War less impactful.  


I have seen a common rebuttal to this, being that the Infinity Stones in that drawer no longer work, due to the fact that they are from other timelines from the main timeline.  
I feel like that specific counter argument hits a bit of a snag when you consider the events of Endgame, where the whole plot is getting another timelines Infinity Stones to use in a different timeline, this contradicting the common support for this plot point.  


I feel that a way to explain this could be that those infinity stones are from ""Reset"" timelines, and that the act of resetting a timeline actually destroys ( ""Melts"" ) it, so any infinity stones from that reset timeline are essentially deprived of power, but that feels more like a theory to ensure that Endgame and Loki don't contradict each other, rather then pure authorial intent.  
We will probably, in time, see further explanation to this point to remedy any confusion concerning this point - although I very well could be wrong.  


&gt;**3. That ""It doesn't make sense that the TVA is so human focused. Why are there only humans here? Why is it a 70's Aesthetic?""**

This point is pretty easy to solve, in Miss Minutes introduction video you can see the earth in the background, which very well could imply that every planet has their own local TVA office. The actual aesthetic may be related to the time when this local TVA office was formed, but we don't have enough evidence to make any calls yet.  


**TL;DR: Overall, I think we should wait and give Loki some time before assuming that the show's framing of the MCU is damaging to the entirety of the setting. I think we should give the show a bit of time and see how it looks by the end of its run before coming to such conclusions.**",1623462417,nxvov9

Not only does it bear a strong resemblance to Kang, with his helmet type thing, furthermore it bears a striking resemblance to Jonathan Majors, and how he would look when outfitted in Kang’s traditional comic book helmet/appearance.

marvelstudios,Any chance of MCU Gods being retconed to be real Gods?,"I mean it will be kinda wacky for Gorr to travel the Universe to kill some aliens who self proclaim - but not really - to be Gods on Earth.

His anger comes from him praying to the Gods and not getting any answer despite comic Gods being truly divine and being able to hear prayers, MCU Thor cannot hear prayers and is not divine, it's kinda meaningless to get angry at an alien like him.

Gorr loves the mortals like him and hates the divine, but there's no different between him and Thor in the MCU, just two aliens with super powers, there's no difference between both of them and Doctor Strange or even the Hulk.

We know that MCU Gods are aliens because back in 2011 the MCU was very scientific, not even magic was a thing, Asgardians used tons of tech instead of being medievel.

But now this is not a problem anymore and in Ragnarok they tried to lean towards something more mystic.

Comic Gorr had a strong motive and argued with Thor a lot, Thor got conflicted for years because of him, but that only works if he is a God.

If MCU Gorr is an alien butcher who kills self proclaimed gods who cannot even hear people's prayers, he will look like a retarded.",1623457060,nxu3l4
marvelstudios,So if you think about it there was no need for time travel in avengers endgame,"Ok so In avengers endgame thanos states that he SHRUNK the infinity stones to atoms. That means they still exist but not able to be seen. Well there is one character who shrunk to an atom size. ANT-MAN. So after Scott comes back to reality from the quantum realm they bring Scott to that planet to shrink down to atom size. Now you’re asking how does he find the stones. Well in avengers they get Bruce to find the tesseract by looking for gamma radiation so with the help of tony, bruce can easily make a infinity stone tracker. Then another problem arises how is Scott going to grab the infinity stones. Well he throws that blue disc at them to make them grow. So by using logic they did not have to time travel to get the infinity stones.",1623456470,nxtwvg
marvelstudios,What if the Evil Variant Loki caused our Variant Loki?,"One thing that has been bothering me is where the TVA says that you can become a variant just by being ""late for work"", etc.  But what can cause this difference if the thing you were supposed to do (being on time for work) is the thing you have always done (from the perspective of the TVA).  I wonder if you actually need an ""outside"" force to pull you off the path you were always supposed to take.  For our Loki the Evil Loki was that outside force.  The TVA said the heist for the Tesseract in 2012 was supposed to happen how it did except that Loki should not have gotten the cube.  Maybe when Hulk hit Tony the Tesseract was only supposed to fly say ten feet away but Evil Loki was there secretly to give it a little push another few feet so our Loki could get his hands on it.  What if Evil Loki NEEDS our Loki for some part of his/her plan and was the one to put all these events in motion.",1623455761,nxtoic
marvelstudios,Question about the timeline Loki was taken out of,"If the TVA erased that timeline in the dessert when they took Loki out, how did cap return the mind stone back to that timeline?",1623455664,nxtnei
marvelstudios,Loki is my favorite show in the MCU so far and here's why,"At the beginning of the first episode, we see 2012 Loki taken by the TVA because he's now a variant and he messed with the sacred timeline. This Loki knows nothing about him becoming a hero and fighting with his brother, Thor, in the future. Until, he sees the video of him in the future saving his brother and becoming a true hero. This changed him already because now he knows what he has to do and he knows it's the right thing to do because he saw his future self do it. He also saw himself and his mother, Frigga die, and this made him cry. He  felt so guilty when Agent Mobius said he basically killed his mother and he felt terrified when he saw Thanos in the future because his future self looked so scared. Now that 2012 Loki knows what's coming, he might make a few adjustments to the timeline. I think this show will be about him going to different periods of time with the TVA to try and stop Loki from the future or Loki from another multiverse from changing the sacred timeline and killing all the minutemen. Then, after he completes his mission, he'll start his real mission. After Agent Mobius sets him free and allows him to go back to his time, he will probably save his mother and probably not go against the titan himself, Thanos which will change the sacred timeline and create multiple timelines in the same universe. After all, he is the god of mischief.",1623455249,nxtik8
marvelstudios,I think I finally know what Rachel Weisz meant when she said pig farm!,"Ok so as many people know, in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Rachel Weisz stated that Melina runs a ""pig farm"". Now, I know she stated that Natasha, Yelena and Alexei are going to meet her at her pig farm meaning that she has a literal pig farm where she lives but what if there was also a metaphor behind it? A deeper meaning that might be important in the movie later on.

Doing a quick research online, I found out that in pig farms, pigs are treated horribly (obviously) but there is one thing that brought my attention. It's the fact that a lot of pigs are castrated. I feel it might be a bit of a stretch but this could be associated with the sterilization procedure the Black Widows go through. Given, I do know that castration and sterilization are two different procedures that may be performed for different purposes (plus we're talking about a procedure made on male reporductive organs vs one that was made on female reproductive organs) but there is the link between the two procedures being performed on sexual organs.

Basically, what if Melina was running the new Black Widow program (or was helping Dreykov running it) behind the scenes and the backs of her ""family"". She might be Iron Maiden.

I also have another theory (although this one leans a bit more on the speculative side) but what if it was Melina who killed Alexei. Most people think that Red Guardian will probably be killed inthe movie so what if after revealing her identity as Iron Maiden and the person who runs the new BW program to Natasha, Yelena and Alexei, she helps Taskmaster(or even does it herself) kill Alexei right in front of Natasha and Yelena. This could be a further motivation for Natasha to defeat her at the end of the movie since I feel like she would have difficulty defeating her mother figure. (although there could be another reason to why Natasha will have no choice to defeat her).",1623454256,nxt7h7

Why Mobius??

Because no one in their right mind would choose loki to fight against loki, thats just a ploy to get as many Loki's as he can to make an army of the most dangerous and mischievious God/Sorcerer so when the time comes they can fight and possibly win against the Time keepers and TVA.",1623453267,nxswc0

In the comics her main mutation is her telepathic power, and her secondary mutation is her diamond form. There are only a few mutants who have secondary mutations but Magneto could be one of them.

marvelstudios,"Loki, divinity, and the essence of humanity.","Can we just take a moment to appreciate the writing and the premise of Loki, and how they make him relatable? (Or a study of Loki and his thoughts on divinity)

I'm late to the party, but wow, what a stunning pilot. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm down to join Loki and help him burn the TVA down to the ground and then hold each others' penises while we piss on the ashes. 

What really makes this for me is Loki's moment of humanity. Yes, he's capable of emotion - jealousy, loss, grief, love - all of that is visible throughout the MCU and this episode. But through all of this, him (and Thor) have thought of themselves as gods, as superior beings that have the strength to shape reality and the universe. Benevolent gods, but gods - something Loki tells Thanos he'll never be. 

And then he's told, without mercy, that every decision and every moment of his life has been foretold, that he's been dancing to the tune of a superior power, that he has never had even the semblance of a choice throughout hai - glorious - life. In that instant, Loki's divinity is shattered, and *that*, for me is when he's at his most human. Gods don't get jerked around by higher powers. Gods don't live their lives by the rules of other beings. Gods aren't trapped in a cage where they're dictated every second of their miserable existence, no matter how pathetic, by someone else. That's for lesser beings. For humans. 

Determinism vs Free Will is an age old debate. The idea that my choices are meaningless, or already predestined ignites something angry inside me, something rebellious and shaking. Would I rather the comfort of knowing my path is set, for better and worse, for good or bad, and find spirituality in the faith of this higher power? Or would I countenance the terrible idea that my choices are my own, that no one is looking out for me, that my path is my own, without that benevolent hand guiding me when I fall? I'd pick the latter. Humanity, in its best moments, hasn't rolled over. It hasn't shown it's belly. We're defined by our ability to question the unknown, to stand on the edge of darkness and scream into the void, to not go gentle into that good night, to rage and rage against the dying light. 

And that, for me, is the hook in Loki. Loki realizes his 'humanity' not through love, or kinship, or redemption. He realizes it through his rebellion against the fact that his life is pre-ordained by a higher power he can never see. The levels of thought that has gone into the writing chills me to my bone - the idea that they can take something that's marketed as popcorn entertainment, and run through it such visceral, universal themes. 

I want Loki to *annihilate* the TVA and the timekeepers. I want Mobius to be the double agent who's horrified at the atrocities done in the name of preserving the flow of time, and recruits Loki into what he's been charged with. I want Loki to rip, tear, and destroy everything, and throw the world into chaos, to herald a multiverse of madness, and laugh in the face of it. For that is what makes us human, our free will, our ability to reconcile the chaos of the universe with our meager, infinite selves. Our rejection of shackles. I want Albert Camus to sit down with Loki over drinks and laugh at the idea of purpose, of meaning, and the beauty of the absence of both. And in that, I want Loki to vindicate my purpose, and my humanity.

Then shouldn't the mere presence of the Avengers in the past change the timeline (Even though they ""fix"" that later) and wouldn't the stones they took be part of another timeline, or does it turn into a new timeline just after they take them? And therefore just their presence and acts in the past didn't alter the timeline?

We find that out at the end that we're chasing another version of him. But what's the end goal if the TVA will step in and control the time/choice of an individual? Loki was or is all about control, but on others, not on himself. Do you remember Loki serving Thanos, but plans to backstab him and gain control? What if he's still that same loki? Wanting to regain proper control over his choices? These are all just in Episode 1 but now comes the spicy part

Remember the Loki on loose is collecting time-line reset charges, or more specifically, time-line erasers? We'll circle back to that. So the animated video shows that there was a huge war between different timelines called the multiverse war? That's when TVA has no control over the time-lines. Which means people get free choice. Or more specifically, Loki in this scenario. The charges Loki kept collecting was to erase a timeline. So what would happen if enough of the ""chosen"" timelines are erased? Yep. Multiverse war between timelines. That also gives Loki a chance to save his mother and father. Because in an alternate timeline, they're still alive. But inoder to get there, he has to disrupt TVA. When it all goes down That's where Dr strange, multiverse of madness comes to play. I hope. Because everything that marvel did until now is connected to each other. Intertwined in each story.

marvelstudios,The central theme of Episode 1 of LOKI was based on a classic moment from one of my favorite Loki comics,"It's from the **""Loki Triumphant""** comic series, which is interestingly enough also about an alternate version of Loki!

I have no clue if this should be considered spoilerly or not since I have no idea if they're gonna take any more ideas from this story and I won't say the ending or anything, but essentially the story is about an alternate timeline where Loki now rules Asgard and everyone recognises it, while Thor is imprisoned in the dungeons. Loki goes down to see him and gloat, and as he does so is visited by the spirit of Balder, his and Thor's other brother whose death Loki engineered long ago. Balder tells Loki that he knows he's going to lose, because during his journey in the afterlife he saw that there are tons of parallel dimensions (the multiverse) each with versions of themselves, and while some details or their looks may be different in some of them, *their roles always stay the same, and Loki's is never to rule.*

This is just like in the first episode of the series, fittingly titled ""Glorious Purpose"", where Loki believes he's destined to be King of Earth and Asgard and rule the cosmos as this great liberator while Mobius is effectively playing the role of Balder and chipping away at the perception, asking Loki why he always loses in the end if he's meant to rule as he says before showing him footage of his future where he doesn't end up as the great King he thought he would be. Just as Balder tells Loki in the comics that the roles are always the same and he's never meant to rule, Mobius tells MCU Loki that the future fate he saw happens ""over and over and over again"" across the multiverse as ""that's the natural flow of time"". Mobius' lines about Loki existing to cause pain and misery and death while ensuring others can become the best versions of themselves are also eerily similar to Balder's 'never meant to rule' jibe.

So all in all, at the very least you can see the similarities and potential inspiration! As I said I have no idea where they're gonna go with this, but as an avid reader of Loki comics, I noticed the similarities with one of my favorite stories instantly! I just think it's such an interesting topic (the idea of your destiny being set in stone and whether you can change it) to explore and I can't wait to see what they do next with it!",1623435006,nxmdqj

marvelstudios,"Dear r/Marvelstudios Creative Community, I'm looking for fellow animators to help me put together a Loki variant of the Superjail intro. Paid!","Hi Marvel Fans! Ever since the Loki premiere, I noticed how the TVA robot resembles Jailbot from Adult Swim's ultraviolent surreal classic Superjail. Then I imagined a Loki spoof of [Superjail's intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSHhm6R7dQ), which totally fits. 

If you have never seen Superjail, it always opens with this belligerent criminal getting his ass kicked by Jailbot before being flown off to an interdimensional prison called Superjail. Along the way, they pass through bizarre landscapes full of strange sights. I highly recommend you watch the intro on YouTube, the intro always changes each episode. It's a work of art.

I want to recreate this, but from Loki's point of view. I need animators to create segments of the bizarre landscapes, except these will be Marvel multiverse shenanigans. You can picture whatever you want, and render however you want it. Do you want to show the X-Men riding a rollercoaster in a Sentinel theme park, in pixel art? Do you want to show the Guardians of the Galaxy playing Dance Dance Revolution, in claymation? Go wild, but not super NSFW! Bear in mind, the landscapes appear only at the bottom half of the screen, so it won't take up the entire screen and will be tiny!

There are eight landscapes in every Superjail intro, appearing on screen each for a total of five seconds. So I'm seeking eight animators to create five seconds of their own unique, bizarre Marvel-related scenarios. I'll be animating Loki being carried off by the robot, Moebius' face forming out of clouds and swallowing Loki and the robot, the TVA appearing at the end, and other interstitial animations. 

I will definitely be paying animators for their time. I have a budget in mind and a fixed fee that I will propose to each interested animator. I think this is a wild concept and I'd like to see it done. If you are an animator, or know any animators, and are a Marvel fan, and want to be part of this kooky project, hit me up on my Reddit DM and we can go from there. Your name or handle will appear in the final credit scene. As an animator myself, I value artists and their time. You can check [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcV052PB8J3JM5yjw0hs8QA) to see the kind of work I've done if you're curious about my credentials.

marvelstudios,The TVA exists to ensure the Time Keepers exist (possible spoilers),"The only really huge spoilers are for Loki S1E1.  
Everything else is personal speculation based on the source comics and educated guessing.   
\------------

The TVA exists to make sure the Sacred Timeline prevails due to a timeline war. The 3 Time Lords(Keepers, whatever) were made to prevent the timeline war from ruining everything by the last TVA agent. The 3 Timey Wimeys were sent to the beginning of time to do this.

Trouble is the 3 Time Twisties are in this more to preserve their existence more than anything.

The thing is if there is not a timeline war no one has reason to create them.

So they want a timeline war that gives reason to give rise to their creation. And if you think about it they don't just want it not happen, they NEED it to happen. They won't be created otherwise.

Why did the Avenger's unclippable branch of Thanos jumping ahead in time not get dealt with?

It's ""supposed to happen"" because that's the catalyst for the timeline war we're going to see play out in the next few movies. The TVA is an unwitting puppet of the Time Trio to create the timeline war they think they are stopping. 

All so the Triple Timeline Trippers can ensure their own existence.

Time is a loop.

And it's time to break the cycle.

Loki's show exists largely to build up the backstory to build this all up. I would bet ""evil"" Loki really is trying to expose what the Time Senate is truly using the TVA for.  


Also with the Avenger's Time Travel thing all the infinity stone branches are clipped by the return of the stones. Steve was always banging Peggy while playing it low key. That paradox paradoctor's itself, and can explain why Peggy's show suddenly stopped. Steve showed up, she quit, and then lied to young Steve when she was old.  


The only truly unclipped branch is Thanos. Tony should have put them back to their place in time, not dust them. And I guess that option wasn't shown to Dr Strange. Could the Time Triplets have prevented Dr Strange from seeing options that could have prevented a timeline war? I suspect Dr Strange only saw what they",1623432854,nxlkoz

Her swords are perhaps the most powerful weapons besides the infinity stones. She can shoot thousands a minute of almost any size building sized to the size of a pencil. 

Now don’t get me wrong Wanda is extremely powerful but what she did to Thanos in endgame wouldn’t work against Hela. Hela can regenerate almost instantly and hela has ranged attacks.

marvelstudios,"Theory on how 'Loki' will end, and how it will fundamentally change how we view his role in the MCU.","I haven't seen this theory anywhere before, so forgive me if the moment of clarity I had last night while thinking about this show and, specifically, its depiction of time travel and Everett and Schrodinger's Many Worlds Theory, is in fact well-known at this stage. However, I'm confident I may have predicted the ending to *Loki*, or at least one of its beats*.* And by ending, I mean the narrative resolution to the set-ups and textual expansion we saw in Episode 1. Naturally, a lot can change here, and I'm only going off approximately 50 minutes of a six-hour series, so I could be way off.

If I'm right, then there a lot of hints, set-ups and dramatic irony seeded in a lot of Loki and Mobius' conversations at the beginning and ending of Episode 1. Additionally, having Loki view his entire lifetime at the TVA Time Theatre, from his imprisonment in Asgard to his death by Thanos will revise Loki's character arc as one that is particularly poignant, borderline tragic, and immensely selfless.

**The theory**

In short, I believe that Loki's narrative doesn't canonically end when the series ends but it will be the last we see of him. As part of the journey he embarks on with Mobius M. Mobius and Hunter B-15 to thwart the villain responsible for killing the Minute Men, he will in fact realise that his place in the Sacred Timeline is precisely where he departed it - the Avengers Tower lobby in 2012, minutes after the end of the Battle of New York. Shorter still, Loki will return to Avengers Tower at the end of the series and live out the rest of his character's canonical experiences from 2012-2019, right up until Thanos kills him, *knowing his fate*, since he has seen it all happen before*.*

**The Sacred Timeline must be preserved**

If we are to believe the TVA's dedication to preserving a ""Sacred Timeline""  (and I realise many theories question the legitimacy of the TVA and the propaganda-esque vibe of characters like the Time Keepers and Miss Minutes), then that means that the timeline we are now in is a branch timeline. It was created by Loki's 2012 escape, similar to what happens in *Donnie Darko* (2001) and *Primer* (2004), but it feels like this series most closely matches the world-structure of the exceptionally good Netflix original *Dark* (2017): it is a timeline that *cannot* be sustained and will eventually be destroyed (by whose hand, it is as yet unclear). As with *Dark*, the only way to close this time loop (or clip this branch timeline, to use TVA jargon) is to remove the Variant that birthed it from it. The TVA call this process ""resetting,"" which presumably returns the ""reset"" Variant to the point where they left their native timeline.

Mobius says it himself - the events Loki sees in the Time Theatre that ""never even happened"" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 30:52) simply haven't happened to him ""yet,"" (Mobius, *Loki* Episode 1, 30:58). Later on, Mobius says he cannot ""offer \[Loki\] salvation,"" (Mobius, *Loki* Episode 1, 43:25) because Loki has a pre-destined path that even he cannot outmanoeuvre. That path ends with Thanos in 2019.

So its clear that the rules of the game are set - if the Sacred Timeline *must* be preserved, there is only one place that Loki can go - he *must* return to his timeline to allow the events of the MCU to play out as they have already.

N.B. While it is likely a Nexus Event may cause the fabric of the Sacred Timeline to eventually break apart (given what we know of *Spider-Man: Now Way Home* and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*), Loki is killed in 2019, so the Loki we know cannot possibly live beyond that point in time for that Universe.

**Mobius is using Loki**

Owen Wilson being cast as Mobius is a stroke of genius because it will throw viewers of the scent of his true intentions. He's far from a villain, but in his first scene, he is shown to be intellectual, empathetic and contemplative, in spite of his apparently goofy presentation in the trailers and some quieter moments between him and Loki. While he is still clearly an ally to Loki, he is still a servant of the TVA before anyone or anything else.

I suspect Mobius is serving a similar narrative purpose as Jon Hamm's character in the *Black Mirror* episode *White Christmas* (2014). His plan is to use Loki to clear up the Nexus Events/reset the Variants his 2012 escape caused/unleashed in the Sacred Timeline, and will then ask him (or somehow otherwise convince/force him) to return to that exact time to live out the rest of his days, in full knowledge of the end of his path.

Notice how, when a dejected, despondent and grieving Loki says ""I can't go back, can I? Back to my timeline,"" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 42:05), Mobius looks at him but never answers. However, *this* Loki is 2012 Loki, an arrogant, devious trickster who, even after being shown the ultimate futility of the Infinity Stones, would never volunteer to live out a timeline where he is responsible for his mother's death. I suspect, at the end of the series, Mobius will still expect Loki to resist, but he will have undergone enough character growth across the series to eventually make the decision to return to 2012 *of his own volition*, thus completing his character arc.

**Poignant and ironic**

This is a particularly poignant inevitability. Loki has always been able to escape - that's who he is. He ultimately made an unexpected escape in *Thor* (2011), *Avengers* (2012, *Endgame* narrative)), *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) and in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017), but since he dies in 2019, that is his predestined path in the Sacred Timeline.

It is particularly ironic in the beginning of the episode that Loki exclaims that ""This is a mistake! I shouldn't be here!"" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 09:15), because he is precisely where the TVA needs him in order to restore the Sacred Timeline. Furthermore, ""You ridiculous bureaucrats will not dictate how my story ends!"" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 17:42) and yet, his story in the MCU Universe has already ended and it is these ""ridiculous bureaucrats"" who must dictate that he return to his timeline. Now, he can only hope the redeem himself by being useful to the TVA and by then returning to his pre-destined path.

**A final thought on determinism**

By the end of Episode 1, Loki is already learning more about the ""formidable"" TVA and how small he is in the vastness of the Universe. He goes from ridiculing Mobius' question about enjoying hurting people (I think he refuses to answer/acknowledge) to quietly admitting ""I don't enjoying hurting people \[...\] I do it because I have to"" (Loki, *Loki* Episode 1, 42:20). He is already accepting he has a pre-destined role to play and only the illusion of free will, and thus foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice he will make by returning to 2012 to face imprisonment, to indirectly cause the death of his mother, the bring about Ragnarok and destroy Asgard and to finally, unsuccessfully, attempt to kill Thanos in 2019.

**Tl;dr:**

Loki died in 2019 and nothing Variant Loki can do will change that. He will end the series by choosing to return to the Avengers Tower lobby in 2012 at the precise point in time that he disappeared, much to the surprise of Thor and the rest of the Avengers, and quietly live the rest of his canonical life in full awareness of his future actions, their ramifications, and the exact moment and means by which he is killed.",1623429790,nxke0m

marvelstudios,A Tale to Astonish,"Honestly, I think that Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne have kinda been sidelined in the Ant Man movies. So I thought of a concept for a 60s set elseworlds movie focusing on the OG Ant Man and The Wasp and there very complex relationship. In the film, Janet would be in her mid 20s and Hank would be in his late 20s-early 30s. The villains would be Whirlwind at the beginning of the movie, but the main primary villains would be Egghead and Nathan Garrett/Black Knight I, and at the final battle of the film, Scarlet Beetle as the big CGI boss villain. Two big plot points would be Hank trying to grow above 12 feet as Giant Man since he can’t find the right calibrations to set his belt to actually survive growing bigger.

marvelstudios,Theory: How Loki is setting up Dr.Strang and Ant-Man,"&amp;#x200B;

So first of, this is a theory. If any part of what I am about to write has already been confirmed or officially denied, I don´t know that, I don´t really keep up with the speculations and rumors. But from the first episode of Loki, i have a couple of, what I believe to be, intersting theories.

The Premise:

The TVA will be destroyed/dismantled etc.:

So from what I´ve gathered during the first episode of Loki, it appears, that we have two Lokis on our hands. Our 2012 protagonist Loki, who this series revolves around, and the ""Loki"" at the end of the first episode, who is commiting crimes against the timeline, which results in the main timeline getting potentially split up into a multiverse, as the informational video during the ticket scene explained, and the TVA hunting him down. Now i believe that this season we will see 2012 Loki trying to undo all those crimes against the timeline, which the other Loki committed/is commiting, in order to protect the timeline and redeem ihmself. Now I believe that while the ""Other Loki"" might be apprehended in the end, the damage he caused to the timeline will already be too grand, therefore causing the formation of a multiverse and setting the road for Dr.Strange: Multiverse of madness and Antman and the Wasp:Quantumania, among others.

Now the emergence of this multiverse will have some effect on the TVA. Maybe it gets destroyed throughout the show, maybe the existence of multiple timelines makes the existence of an agency, which only protects a singular strain of time, obsolete and it gets dismanteled, depowered or ""nerfed"" but I believe, that some fundamental shift of power, towards the worse of the TVA, will occur.

This, I believe, will have consequences for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Antman and the Wasp: Quantumania and possibly even other upcoming MCU projects. Below I have listed some possibilities, of how this could work out.

1. Nightmare:

When Loki gets a look at the ""TVA-City"" for the first time, he says: ""This is a nightmare."" To which Mobius replies: ""No, that´s a whole other department."" I believe that this departement controls the dreams (and therefore nightmares) of sentient beings, or Humans at the very least. Now if a being like nightmare - who, to my knowledge, has already been confirmed to be the main villain in Dr. Strange 2 - commits crimes against the order of dreams, just like Loki commits crimes against the order of time, it would make perfect sense to me, that this department (of the TVA?) would use its resources to apprehend this being. And if that were the case, the collapse of such an institution could mean, that this being is released to the multiverse, or the main universe of the MCU because the existence of a multiverse doesn´t necessarily mean, that he can travel it freely.

This would mean, that at this point, nightmare is being held by the TVA and gets released when the TVA collapses. They might have even captured him, in order to harness his powers to control dreams in the first place.

2. Kang

Kang is a time keeper and part of the TVA. I´m not to familiar with Kang in the comics, but even I know, that time travel is kinda his thig. I believe, that he is a timekeeper, specificially the leader of the TVA and the whole society, the seem to be bound to. According to my theory, the end of Loki will see the fall of this empire, for which he might want revenge. He wants revenge on earth, for breaking the timeline and especially on Ant-Man (and the Wasp) for bringing earth the technology needed, to break the timeline in the first place. So he wants to exert revenge by caputring earth (other worlds might follow, he´s a conqueror, after all). He might also have been conquering worlds, in order to acquire resources like weapons and technology, to prepare for his conquest of earth.

3. Spiderman, into the Spiderverse and Spiderman: No Way Home

Now I actually just thought of this, as i was writing the theory above, but bear with me:

What if a particle accelerator like the one, that Kingpin used, had the potential to access different universes, or, by definition, different timelines within the universe? That means, that as long as there is only one singular, TVA protected timeline, this potential can not unfold, because there simply are no other timelines to access. Particle accelerators would the ""only"" do what they say: accelerate particles.

This also means that, as soon as the main timeline starts to split even ONCE, particle accelerators might be used for interdimensional travel, like we at least fundamentally see in Into The SpiderVerse and that this technology would hypothetically allow for Spiderman: No Way Home to become the multiversal fan-fest, that everyone wants it to be.

4. When does the Multiverse come to existence?

Now all of this poses the intersting question, ""When did the timeline break?"" and naturally and logically, you would assume the first time the ""other Loki"" breaks the timeline irreversibly wight be the point in the main timeline, from which all timelines spring, but I believe there´s more:

When he presents him the ""Highlights of his life"" Mobius tells Loki that ""This is how it´s supposed to go, over and over and over again!""

Now this could mean that this timeline loops infinetly often. But what does it loop around? Time has neither a beginning nor an end, so when would the loop begin and end? Furthermore if the whole timeline repeats and resets itself voluntarily already, the existence of an institution, such as the TVA would become obsolete and everything that´s happening in the MCU less intersting, if you ask me.

I think that a timeline like the MCU happens infinetly often, somewhat simultaneously, shifted by an infinite amount of times, relative to the MCU timeline. What I mean by this is that a new timeline/universe is being born constantly, shifted temporarily by an infinite amont of times, so basically we could have an universe, which might be one milion years behind the MCU, while another is only an attosecond of. Think of it like the one episode of Rick and Morty, with the ""save point Remote"", but branched out infinetly. If Thanos snaps in the main universe, he might also snap in the other universes, but never at the EXACT same time. This would open up the whole possibility of the multiverse, because if we regard the initial destruction of the TVA in the main MCU timeline as a fixed point in time ACROSS ALL UNIVERSES, then all universes born after that initial destruction are constantly branching out from the very beginning of their existence (never hindered by the TVA), while those born before the initial branching of are only starting to branch out from the point in time, which is equal to the initial breaking in the main MCU. So basically when a theorethical universe was born an hour before the Loki timeline which we are observing now, it´s starting to branch out simultaneously to the MCU, but since it is an hour ""older"" it´s like it´s branching out later than the MCU",1623426532,nxj4ak
marvelstudios,Spider-Man: No Way Home Trailer Speculation and Loki Connections,After episode one of Loki everything we thought we new about the Multiverse in the MCU was turned upsidedown. We know now that the multiverse has been condensed into one “sacred timeline”. It is only a matter of time before before the Loki variant or some other force unravels this timeline resulting in a rebirth of the multiverse. For this reason I believe Marvel and Sony are holding off on dropping the NWH trailer until after this event occurs in Loki. What do you all think about this?,1623425820,nxiut5
marvelstudios,Why was Loki apprehended by the TVA when Cap wasnt? (Spoilers Episode 1),Title says it most.

Captain America did the exact same thing when he returned most of the stones but (Russo Bros Confirmed) didnt return back he created a new timeline to live out his personal ambitions. So why didnt they capture Steve Roger's and reset him? They may have thrown in the line about The Avengers were always suppose to time travel but seems like a major plot hole to me.,1623425753,nxitw9

So I'm wondering what Strange may have saw in all those other outcomes. If that 1 win scenario is true to the sacred timeline, wouldn't it stand to reason that the TVA would have gotten involved in all those other outcomes? Did Strange learn of them then?

Best case scenario in my head: Avengers 7 is Avengers vs X-Men from another multiverse, ending with them realizing they should be on the same side and leading into Avengers 8, which will see them team up against something that is a threat to the entire Multiverse, The TVA,  who now want to ""reset"" the entire multiverse to end the war. Then Avengers 8 ends with Mobius becoming the new head Timekeeper when the current three are defeated. This is when we will finally here the legendary ""wow"" as he enters the Hall of the Timekeepers or whatever its called for the first time.

This leads me into the part where I try to predict Loki's main plot. The ""Evil"" Loki is actually just our Loki from the future, trying to destroy the TVA before they can go ""rogue"" (basically what Rhodie said about Thanos in a way, but Loki trys to ""do what he has to do"" where the avengers didn't), at the end of the show the two Loki's and Mobius will meet and talk, Mobius will understand after slowly growing to trust Loki and maybe seeing some of the shady stuff that the TVA is doing behind closed doors.

And most notably, it seems like everyone they arrested was saying “I didn’t do anything” or “You got the wrong person” which leads me to believe that whenever someone is messing up a timeline, they aren’t going after the person who messed it up, they are going after the individuals that were lead into some stray timeline because of the actions of someone else.

Weird in that him existing has to happen as part of the sacred time's sequence of events.

Also weird that rather then bonking Loki on the back of the head in Mongolia and dumping him with The Avengers they decide to reset the time line. Presumably killing everyone, what exactly is resetting a timeline by the way.

marvelstudios,"Questions about the TVA and the ""rules"" of the universe","I've been wondering about the world the TVA exist in, and was wondering if any comic readers can shed some light on this.

From the very nature of their existence, we can assume they aren't actually in the MCU's universe. They're in another universe/dimension/whatever, and can view our universe and timeline from outside. The Infinity Stones are fragments from the beginning of the universe, but the TVA aren't in that universe, so the stones do nothing in this ""place"".

That being said, their space has properties like the normal universe, such as three physical dimensions (or at least that's what we perceive) and a flow of time. People in this place move and have a past, present and hopefully future. Their collars move beings to locations they occupied in previous times, and works on both Loki and the Agent, so it's not just something that works on beings that come out of the normal universe.

So my questions are these:

1. This is a timeline. Can TVA agents travel to the past in their own universe? Or the future? 

2. Can the TVA timeline branch out and have multiple TVAs trying to prune each other, each believing themselves to be the true TVA?

3. What happens if a TVA agent travels to a point in space-time where another TVA agent once visited? Can they interact? Have they always interacted? Do they have a system to identify when each of them is coming from?

4. What if agent Mobius makes up his mind to visit himself where he is right now and give himself information about a case? Will he then not have to investigate the case because he already has the answer?

I guess that eventually, my real question is this (read at your own risk): &gt;!My theory currently is that the Devil Loki that Mobius is hunting is actually our Variant Loki in his future, working to dismantle the TVA after escaping at some point. Could such a Loki have found a way to use his powers in the TVA universe, and therefore disguise himself and be literally anyone our Loki is interacting with? Could he actually travel to his past in the TVA and be working on altering events that the TVA can't know aren't meant to happen, because it's in their universe?!&lt;

marvelstudios,Loki's (the show) explanation for how the Sacred Timeline is predetermine makes no sense if variants are even a possibility.,"The TVA states that everything within the MCU is on the Sacred Timeline, which was said to be completely predetermined by The Time Keepers. This means that no one has free will and everything to ever happen post the creating of the timeline is completely under the control of the people who created it. This aligns perfectly with Loki's beliefs in The Avengers, when he says that ""freedom is life's great lie."" He didn't mean freedom under a government; he meant freedom of choice. 

If this is the case, why would The Time Keepers write into the timeline that someone would break it and then create a whole agency to stop them? It seems very unnecessary.

Also, I assume the judge started that the Avengers were supposed to time travel because they also intended to go back and fix everything so there wouldn't be any alternate timelines. But if everything was predetermined, then why was Loki taking the Tesseract not supposed to happen?

marvelstudios,Variant Loki?,"As I mentioned in a couple of comments in this subreddit, I don't believe Loki is a Variant. It has taken a few hours but there are some things that don't make sense or support this.

First of all, Loki actually escaping ... was supposed to happen. We know the scene, Alt-Tony goes to grab the Tesseract and gets knocked down by Hulk leaving the stairwell, the secure case for the Tesseract pops open and the pretty blue cube slides directly to Loki's feet, instead of it being handed to SHIELD custody. Why wasn't Thor watching Loki like a hawk? He knows Loki will always try something it is just in his nature. When there was a distraction, Thor should have stared at Loki like it was his fault. Also, why didn't one guard turn to face Loki directly when there was a distraction? This guy just tried to wipe out humanity, I wouldn't trust him to blink without him being watched. It was an omnishambles of a situation. But then I remembered something...

End of The Avengers Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard.

Wait, what? How!? We know the heist was supposed to happen, including the failed attempt, because if they didn't fail there they wouldn't have gone back in time... So things going 'as planned' They hand the Tesseract over to SHIELD for safekeeping? But if that does occur then Thor can't return it to Asgard, right? So clearly something had to happen to change the minds of all involved for the Tesseract to leave Earth with Thor. Like say, Loki escaping with it... due to mishandling of situation by human personnel?

Hang on, Tesseract is the Space Stone, right? But when Loki used it, he went back IN TIME to a whole new location. That makes no sense. He could move through space, but how did he go back CENTURIES? That makes no sense at all, that isn't how it works... How did Loki travel through time? Or should I say, who/what MOVED Loki through time?

And Variant... Loki is wrong on a factual level. Loki escaping from custody, or trying to? Very in his nature, right? He still believed he did nothing wrong, so escaping would be his due diligence. That isn't a variation of his behaviour at all. That is pure Loki. One last trick, one last escape. And his shining ego is all Loki as well. He is one of the most narcissistic villains in the MCU, look how he portrays himself at first in the TVA. That isn't Variant Loki.

Huh? But the paperwork, you say? A bureaucracy as powerful as the TVA would never mistake a Variant for the genuine article. I haven't worked in a bureaucracy before, but I do understand systems to a point, and if you know what you are doing, you would be horrified at what you could get away with, especially if you are say a highly decorated TVA Agent who needs a Genuine Article to take down a Variant...

How do you get a Genuine to help take down a Variant? You need to be highly attentive to detail, charming, intelligent, ruthless, manipulative, and allow yourself to be played when needed. You must let them reach the conclusion by themselves, like letting them see the 'future' to get them to the point where they would be willing to help.

If this theory is true... doesn't it put Loki's interment on Asgard in a mortifying new light. When Freya speaks with Loki, is she actually telling her son that he can be better, or is she trying to tell him 'Farewell'.

But, this is after the pilot episode and the series has the rest of its run to prove me wrong. But, there are points raised that need to be taken into consideration, especially given Marvel's attention to continuity.",1623413585,nxej8t

marvelstudios,Confused about Bucky's public persona. How were Madripoor criminals so easily swayed that it was the Winter Soldier and not Bucky? Wasn't he was publicly pardoned under the assumption that he could not longer be controlled? Etc. (FatWS),"I absolutely loved the show, but this ""small"" detail that drove a whole episode still irks me. So maybe I missed something. Or maybe I'm just needlessly overanalysing the whole thing :D

Some random police officers in ep2 ask Bucky (who they recognise as an Avenger) to come with them, as he has violated some very specific rule of parole that they well seem to know about. Then you have some people (ep1) acting like they don't know who he is, at all. So does he go by a different name in his everyday civilian life? Because if not, then a quick google search would suffice to know that he was the Winter Soldier. Which would imo be quite a 'baggage' you'd have with you from other people's perspective. And Yori would be just a bit suspicious why WS is befriending him, having had his son be killed due to some unknown circumstance. 

So let's assume as a civilian, he goes by a different name.   
Which would have been a much needed small addition, to clear this up. But ep1 companions never address Bucky by name. And I would have then ep5 (Sam's companions) address Bucky with his real name. Showing that he kept his WS identity intact to some extent, if that need to use it ever arose. But after what happened in Madripoor, he knew his cover was blown. Would've been more of an arc as well, compared to what we got. 

Then in the very end, when Sam brings Isaiah to the museum... he sees Bucky from afar reading his own plaque from afar. But the notices Yori and Leah(?) in front of Bucky, both intently reading all information about him. So just like in ep6 he was being accepted by the military forces as Srg. Barnes, now the civilians in his life begin to accept him as a hero as well. 

So in the beginning he was alone, using a fake name to not have weird interactions with everyday. I mean, it'd be pretty hard to bring yourself to be casual friends with a 35-year-old neighbor who you know was the world's top assassin for 70 years. Anyhow, Bucky feels discomfort because he cannot tell people too much about himself - which we actually also see in ep1, which I really liked. But in the end he goes by his real name and tells them everything. Because he realises that there are those willing to accept him, even with all the skeletons in his closet. 

All in all, I think we got a lot with Sam's identity in regards to how he sees himself and in relation to the public. But we should have gotten a bit more with Bucky, because I think there was much to work with there.",1623410359,nxdk6f
marvelstudios,7 Pointed Star?,I noticed a 7 pointed star on the glass piece with the devil. There's 3 of em and the moon was in the same phase as the symbols for the O's on kablooie gum. Anyone know the meaning behind it? I feel like it being 7 pointed is some nod at something because it's a bit of a weird thing right?,1623410349,nxdk2c
marvelstudios,So Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a nexus now....,"I saw the first episode of Loki yesterday and, as a fan of AOS, I was quite excited to see the explanation of Coulson's death in the TVA, and the answer was as expected but a little disappointing. So, it seems that, according to the ""holy timeline"" dicted by the time guardians, Coulson is dead and that's how it should be. If there's no mention for his ressurection, so we can assume that timeline is a nexus and never actually happened? Maybe the TVA agents erased that timeline of existence after the last episode?",1623409723,nxddrw
marvelstudios,Thoughts on Immortus? (slight Loki spoilers),"I've spoken of Immortus before and I will continue to do so as multiversal events unfold.

When / how do you folks reckon Immortus will appear?

In Loki, the TVA are literally doing what Immortus did in the comics: erasing certain variant branches of time according to the will of the time keepers...

One of my favourite things about Kang is all the different versions of him that exist and watching them all interact together, I hope we get to see Immortus but I'm not gonna set up expectations and am keen for whatever story unfolds either way.

Excited ! What do y'all think ?",1623407907,nxcwbo
marvelstudios,[Loki E01] Something I thought was a flaw was actually a very smart choice,"Right after I saw the first episode - Don't get me wrong, I loved it as a whole - I  thought Hiddleston's acting was a bit off, which surprised me since I know him to be a ***phenomenal*** actor. What was even weirder was the fact that he ***is*** phenomenal in some scenes, and in other scenes he was just... okay? It was a bit awkward and stilted. 

A few hours later, my stupid brain finally understood: Tom's acting ***is*** stellar all throughout the episode, but ***Loki's*** isn't. And that makes so much sense. The episode was basically saying that Loki pretends to be the villain (gross shortcut but you understand me) so that's actually incredible that everyone on the show managed to make me think ""I don't believe in this acting"" because that's exactely the point. This is Loki's acting skills put to the test by a very intense shift in his understanding of the world. And Hiddleston nailed it.

I'm going to blame my tiredness and my headache for not getting it right when I was watching the episode (I have got to protect my ego and find an excuse for this lapse in judgment).",1623407456,nxcs64
marvelstudios,The Avengers didn't need to return the infinity stones,The ancient one's concerns about being overrun by the forces of evil without the time stone dont even matter since the TVA deleted that timeline as we see at the start of episode 1 with the resetter device in the Desert.,1623407059,nxcokv

marvelstudios,Answers to all your LOKI FAQ,"**What is a multiverse exactly?**

The Multiverse is literally all of existence and it includes 3 things:  
  
•Branches of the sacred timeline, which in reality don't exist, because the TVA prunes them right after they start branching, and resets all the beings and objects inside them to their sacred timeline selves so they can continue their predetermined life path.  
  
•Alternate realities (like the Earth-616 which is the main comic reality or the Rami-verse or the X-Men-verse)  
  
•Alternate Dimensions (like Dormammu's Dark Dimension, the Astral plane, the Mirror Dimensions etc)


**Why was Tony losing the Tesseract predetermined but Loki escaping wasn't?**

Maybe the predetermined path would be for a SHIELD agent to grab the Tesseract after Tony lost it. We really don't know. The timeline would be pruned either way. It's just that Loki did something that the Timekeepers didn't want to happen. It's all really absurd.

I mean why wasn't Gamora arrested too? Probably cause this is what the Timekeepers want. The lives of trillions are being dictated by 3 space lizards. All of your questions can be answered by: because that's what the Timekeepers wanted.


**So were the other universes created by the Avengers pruned?**

Most likely, since the 2012 universe was pruned.


**What about Cap's universe?**

How do you know it wasn't a ""unique loop"" as the writers of Endgame called it and Steve was her husband all along? Maybe if you go to the past and make no changes (Deke's ripples and waves theory), you stay in the sacred timeline. Bruce and the Ancient One never clarified whether the branch happens the moment a time traveler goes to the past or the moment they change something.

Since the Timekeepers allowed it, it must have been Cap and Peggy's predetermined life path according to them. 


Either way, Micheal Waldron said they will really explain time travel the best they can in this series and they have tried to cover all possible questions that might come up, so I'm confident we'll get our answers (mostly about Cap and **what exactly is needed for the timeline to branch**, which is really the only basic question we still haven't answered).

I'm expecting Mobius to explain time travel to Loki next episode when he officially recruits him.",1623403500,nxbrv4
marvelstudios,Chadwick Boseman saved my wife's life.,"I don't have Twitter or Instagram to let his family know, but my wife was diagnosed with Stage 2 Stomach Cancer. We have two young kids. She just had a successful Gastrectomy that removed her entire stomach. If it wasn't for Chadwick, she would've ignored the dull pains in her stomach chalking it up to acid reflux. She thought she could've possibly had colon cancer, and his death made her take this issue seriously. She ended up getting a colonoscopy and an endoscopy and discovered she had an ulcer. They did a biopsy and discovered she had Stage 2 Gastric Adenocarcinoma. Stomach cancer is apparently rare and virtually unheard of for someone in their mid 30s. Thankfully and hopefully, this surgery and subsequent treatment should fix everything.

 She's gotten yearly check ups and blood work, and this didn't show up at all. If it wasn't for him, my wife would've never made her first appointment to get this checked out and we could've discovered this far too late. This post may get removed or buried, but I hope Chadwick's family knows how much of an impact he has had on my wife and our family. Chadwick Boseman saved my wife's life. 

Please get yourself and your loved ones checked.",1623403028,nxbnqv
marvelstudios,Gamora should be arrested by The time variance authority too!!,Well as we all know in the sacred timeline thanos snaps his fingers and dies on his new home planet but in avengers endgame (2014) gamora brings thanos’s army to 2023 making all of them the variants but all if them died except gamora shouldn’t she be arrested by tva.,1623402745,nxbl6x

marvelstudios,Did Loki answer one of the most hotly debated plot points from Endgame?,"The big debate following Endgame, amongst both fans and the creators themselves, was the fate of Steve Rogers after he stayed in the past. The Russos, the directors, declared he lived his life in an alternate timeline and then jumped back to give Sam the shield. Markus and McFeely, the writers, said he lived his life in the prime MCU timeline all along, and that Steve was Peggy’s secret husband that we never got to see.

Now, per the new lore we’ve learnt in Loki, we see that the TVA work to preserve a single timeline, the Sacred Timeline, with *extreme prejudice* pruning and resetting (read, annihilating) any Variants that threaten the Sacred Timeline. Now we’re told that the Time Heist was meant to happen, as was Steve living in the past, but we also see in an early scene, with Mobius and the kid in the church, that any Nexus event very quickly threatens the Sacred Timeline, it must be pruned in matter of hours at the most before it goes “into the red” and becomes a threat to the Sacred Timeline.

There’s no way they would let Steve live 90 years in an alternate timeline before resetting it. Any divergent timeline is a threat to the Sacred Timeline and the TVA. 

Going by the new lore of the TVA, it’s the strongest evidence yet that Cap lived his “second life” in the past all through the Sacred Timeline (AKA the Prime MCU timeline) and that he was always Peggy’s secret husband all along. He wasn’t pruned as a Variant because he was always *meant* to live his life again in the Sacred Timeline, meaning whatever he did in the past has already happened any, and thus didn’t affect the timeline. 

There’s a good chance that Old Steve has had several run ins with the TVA through his life with Peggy, heck he could have been on all kinds of adventures in secret in order to preserve the Sacred Timeline with them, or fighting against them to try and change things about it unsuccessfully, but either way it explains how Steve could live an entire life in the past, with all his knowledge of the future, and not change anything, because the TVA makes sure everything occurs as it’s meant to. Any “changes” he made by being there would have ensured events occurred as they were supposed to anyway.",1623402117,nxbfzg
marvelstudios,The MCU Post Endgame Trauma arc,"I think it's safe to say everything After Endgame to now have all been about the character processing thier trauma. Peter and Sam about filling the roles of the deceased and or retired. Wanda, Loki and Bucky all dealing with thier own personal trauma. I'm enjoying this breather before stuff gets crazy again. Most likely when Loki ends.

I do think this may be a trend in alot of other projects in the future. Would be surprised if we see Natasha and Rhodey dealing with some personal traumas next time we see them.",1623401063,nxb6uj
marvelstudios,Just watched Loki. I have some serious multiverse/ timeline questions. There's only one true timeline? What?!,"Watching the first episode really hurt. Not my feelings but my head. Too many questions. Before it was like oh okay cool so there's multiple universes and timelines okay. But now a universal agency says there's only timeline and that's final. Anything that branches from the timeline is destroyed, if not it turns into a multiverse, and we can not have that (according to the TVA). So what about Dr strange? He looks into thousands of timelines to find the right one. What about the new spiderman movie supposedly having all three other spidermen? What about X-Men for Christ sake. Obviously the question is how to explain the existence of X-Men this far into the movies? Multiverse. Okay now what after there's only one timeline. 

How do you explain all this by saying there is only one true timeline?",1623400326,nxb0ej

marvelstudios,Secret Wars (2015) and Loki (the TV Show),"Secret Wars (2015) Comics Background:

Doctor Doom figured out how the multiverse was being destroyed in a long and complex (and very good) arc (the Incursions), and manipulated the process in order to become God Emperor Doom. His domain? Battleworld, which was a patchwork world consisting of Marvel's most popular alt realities (e.g. Old Man Logan, Marvel 1602) and some more generic concepts. However, the Illuminati figured out a way of escaping this process and convinced Doom that Reed Richards could do a better job. Reed then used his son Franklin (then one of, if not the most, powerful reality warping mutants) to recreate the multiverse. (Molecule Man may have helped, I can't remember.)

The MCU:

As many of you know, the MCU is officially [Earth 199999](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-199999) and is part of the wider Marvel multiverse. This means one of two things:

1. it will be destroyed by an incursion event
2. it's one of the universes Reed and Franklin created

Loki:

In Episode One, we learn this:

&gt;Long ago, there was a vast multiversal war. Countless unique timelines battled each other for supremacy, nearly resulting in the total destruction of, well, everything. [...] reorganising the multiverse into a single timeline, the sacred timeline.

There are several ways we can understand this, but one way of looking at it is that the TVA is about policing branching timelines from the MCU only. This is to be contrasted with the view that there is only one multiverse. 

Now, the video in Loki attributes the reorganisation process to the TVA's founders but what I want to draw your attention to the authorisation on the video:

&gt;Time Variance Authority Narrative Commission 

Doesn't that just sound like a propaganda agency to you? A ministry of truth?

Proposition:

1. the battle for supremacy is a propagandistic explanation for Battleworld/the Incursions/Secret Wars
2. the Time Keepers *didn't* solve Secret Wars: they just discovered its existence and came up with a lie to explain the evidence if anyone else found it that just so happened to empower themselves (cf the Authority in His Dark Materials)
3. Franklin created the MCU, i.e. it's one of the new realities from the end of the second Secret Wars

And the implication going forwards is:

1. the rogue Loki is a kind of Asriel type character that's discovered the Truth
2. there is a multiverse, the TVA just stop new ones being created out of the MCU timeline rather than there being just the one timeline (aka universe)",1623389997,nx8glg
marvelstudios,Does Loki set up Kang the Conqueror?,"I have had a thought about the MCU going forward. Whatever might happen after Endgame the question was always going to be, why don't the avengers just go back and get the infinity gems again? Well Loki makes a point that in a greater world they're kinda just paper weights. If Kang were to exist in any way similar to the comics the TVA would have to be destroyed. If Kang can destroy an agency that uses the stones as paper weights, marvel effectively solves this issue.

Just to clarify, I didn't see any hint of Kang in episode 1, but it seems like the groundwork is being laid.",1623389935,nx8fx5
marvelstudios,[SPOILERS] I think Loki ep. 1 just solved a big plot hole in Endgame,"It's regarding the 2014 timeline, in that timeline Thanos, Gamora and Nebula disappear meaning the Guardians would have never formed but it could be that the TVA showed up after and reseted the timeline so there would still be a Nebula, Gamora and Thanos in that timeline",1623389128,nx87zo
marvelstudios,How I Think MCU Time Travel Works,"So, in Endgame, we see that any time travel to the past of your timeline creates a new timeline. And in Loki, it's implied that alternate timelines are pruned by the TVA, and the variant in that timeline taken into custody. So, does that mean that timelines like Peggy and Cap don't really exist? And if they do, why doesn't the TVA prune their timeline? And why don't the Avengers get into trouble with the TVA too if they created alternate timelines? Well, I think that alternate timelines are fine, as long as they are mostly similar to the Sacred Timeline.

In the Miss Minutes animation, we are given a visual representation of the Sacred Timeline. Notice how it isn't a single thread, but multiple threads being united. I think that the Sacred Timeline isn't one single timeline, but a collection of mostly identical timelines. The TVA is fine with that, but the problem begins when a timeline deviates from the Sacred Timeline too much. When it does, and it hits the red line, it becomes much more difficult to contain and could lead to the second multiversal war.

The reason why Loki is captured and not the Avengers is because the Avengers were doing their best to not make the alt-timelines too different from the Sacred Timeline. They aren't perfect, of course, but they did as they were supposed to. Tony and Steve left Alternate 1970 almost identical to the Sacred Timeline, so the TVA doesn't intervene. Cap's return to the 1940's doesn't change much on the cosmic scale, so the TVA doesn't prune his timeline. Personally, I think that the only timelines pruned are Alternate 2012 and Alternate 2014 (because of Thanos disappearing, that would cause the timeline to deviate a lot).

Loki on the other hand, is much more powerful, has greater reach, and doesn't care if his timeline deviates from the Sacred Timeline. He creates a major diversion in the timelines by escaping from the Avengers, even if the events that led up to it weren't his fault. This brings Alternate 2012 close to the red line, so the TVA intervenes. They take Loki in particular because he caused substantial damage to the timeline.

Now, there is the question of why Alternate Gamora is allowed to travel to the Sacred Timeline. You can make the case that it's fine for Thanos and his army to travel because they get their comeuppance anyway, but why is it fine for Gamora to leave Alternate 2014 and cause that timeline to deviate, without any known repercussions? There's the possibility of the TVA being destroyed by the end of the show and thus not being able to get around to this, or something in GotG 3, or that she's in the Sacred Timeline anyway so she technically isn't a variant in the same way that Loki is. I personally don't have a good answer for this, so feel free to theorize.",1623388832,nx8546
marvelstudios,"""Loki"" Theory","Just hear this out.  
Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) tells us that the variant they're hunting is Loki himself.  And this hooded persona seems to know a great deal about the TVA \[ For eg. He (or *she*, more on that later) **knows how to erase his/her time signature, and also steals reset charges** \] .  
The main job of the TVA and its clowns, I mean ,employees is to maintain the Sacred Timeline, and none of them would go against that rule..But Owen Wilson doesn't want to send 2012 Loki back yet.  
So, could it all signify that the same **2012 Loki evolves into the Hooded person** ? And exactly that is **actually a part of the overall timeline** ?  
Some clues to point this out :  
1) All through the first Loki trailer, there are many instances which look like Loki is against the TVA and fighting them..  
2) His scene with Lady Loki seems like **they are in this together** and have a mutual understanding..So it's possible that Lady Loki has a BIG role in the entire flow of events..Like her being the Hooded person or She is the one who changes the 2012 Loki..  
3) There are wayyy too many references to Loki being the Frostgiant heir - The blue gum with a eerily frostgiant like face on it, The throne and palace shots etc. Hence, **Loki might assume that he lost his throne and power because of the TVA controlling everything as per the Time-keepers' order** and so turns into the Variant that's causing the TVA trouble..

marvelstudios,"The Theory of Everything and how we just saw the start of Phase 5, not 4. Lots of Spoilers ahead.","My huge theory for Phase 4 and 5 :  


So everyone keeps saying we just had our Phase 4 villain confirmed with Kang and now they'll build to it, but I can believe you guys haven't realized we've seen the Phase 4 villain for a while now. Marvel builds for 2 phases seems to be their standard. Phase 1 was about putting our players in motion, but it also sets the stage for Phase 3. Marvel is always playing a long game. By the end of phase 1, we have 2 Infinity Stones in play and Thanos' first reveal all without informing the audience of what they'd seen.  We get explanations in Phase 2 with Dark World explaining Infinity Stones and Guardians explaining Thanos, and then Phase 3 brings everything together. But that doesn't mean that we start all over. 3 phases each maybe, but not end-to-end storylines.

&amp;#x200B;

The Villains for Phase 4 was revealed in Phase 2 in Guardians of the Galaxy, the Celestials. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are introduced to the severed head of one implying something could actually kill it, remember this, and we see one destroy a planet which, guess what, that's going to come back around too. We were then given more explanation for them in Phase 3 in Guardians 2 with Ego and Peter's parentage, and even more so in Endgame. ""Huh?"" You say? That's right. Why do you think Thanos' planet was so fucked up with its gravity all messed up. You thought ""too many hungry mouths to feed"" altered a planet's gravity? Titan was the home of the Eternals, Thanos is an Eternal. The Eternals as the true believers know were created by the Celestials, and their planet was destroyed by them as well.  How? We're almost there.    


Phase 4 

&amp;#x200B;

 The Eternals movie will initiate the threat showing how we are their experiment and how they are going to come back and kill us if we aren't evolving how they wanted us to fast enough (ie mutants baby!) to power up their CELESTIAL EGG in our planet. Yeah.... the egg thing. In the comics Celestials give birth to other Celestials by essentially putting an egg in a planet and having a race evolve on the surface to power it up. When it wakes up, it basically all but destroys the planet. Thanos knew this and his plan was to kill enough people so the Eggs couldn't reach maturity across the universe thereby killing the Celestials population growth. He foresaw a universe overrun by Celestials because his home was destroyed by one. ""You will never be a god."" Loki said, but Thanos doesnt want to be a god, just kill them.  I'm not sure how far this will get in Eternals, but if there is an Egg in Earth and especially if it only partially wakes like plot leaks have said, then there is only one thing in all of Marvel comics that is specifically known for eating Celestial Eggs and keeping their population in check. 

&amp;#x200B;

GALACTUS.

&amp;#x200B;

Look. We know already that the Phase 4 logo they use in advertising is essentially the Fantastic Four logo. It makes sense that this phase, Phase 4, ends with the first family of Marvel as the huge event movie especially as the Avengers are still reloading after losses. I don't think it's a coincidence that Ant Man gave us time travel and gave us a window into vintage heroes in the 60's with the original Ant Man and Wasp. I think the convergence of these two Ideas happens in Ant Man 3 where I believe we will get both Kang, a time-traveling villain, and the Fantastic Four making a trip through time to the present day after chasing Doctor Doom who stole Pyms tech into the Quantum realm. Look at the Quantumania logo, I think the choice of blue for the logo even though it clashes with the Ant Man color palette is a very deliberate choice and reference. I also don't know if I believe that Kang will be the villain for the whole movie, or if he will just come in at the end as a future threat for phase 5 like Thanos did in Guardians 1. Kang could be a super long-term villain or not. I think he may be a vanguard villain, his purpose in the story would be to tell us about something so bad that he had to conquer timelines and kill zillions of people to prevent it.  I'm pretty sure the TVA in Loki was made by Kang to keep his perfect timeline running. It's far too villainous. I mean did no one realize that the TVA in just that first episode of Loki did worse than Thanos ever did?? They wiped out an entire timeline. Untold numbers of sentients erased. The rest of Phase 4 builds the Celestial Egg Problem and cameos the FF in other movies and a random mutant here and there until they find out Galactus is on its way probably with the Silver Surfer showing up randomly at the end of a different movie. What an end-credits scene that will be. The culmination will be the most famous Fantastic Four story ""The Coming of Galactus"". Phase 4 done.

&amp;#x200B;

Phase 5

So we are definitely headed to SECRET WARS as it and Infinity Gauntlet are the greatest legacy crossovers in all of Marvel, the first reference I saw to Secret Wars in the MCU was in Endgame when Hulk held up the blown-up Avengers base, thats a famous [Secret Wars Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/cmx-images-prod/Item/13302/ICO001757._SX1600_QL80_TTD_.jpg) . ALL the time travel/multiple universe stuff is setting up this.  The current situation is the literal opposite of 2015 comic Secret Wars which had a multiverse war lead to a single mashed-together timeline. I think  mutants will be coming to the forefront, and the universe starts to ""collide"" with the newly formed multiverse like the cartoon in Loki showed. DOCTOR DOOM shows up out of nowhere as the huge threat Kang warned about because when the FF chased him into the Quantum realm he never emerged.  Doom is also the only character that would hate not having free will more than Loki so he tears apart the sacred timeline to gain power. So the story will essentially be liberation of the multiverse and in doing so will prove Kang correct leading to a multiverse war. SECRET WARS.

I can't even guess past this. The sky is the limit A multiversal war for sure. We'll definitely get dead characters like Cap and Tony back for movies. It'll probably be a weird remix of all Secret wars stories which means Doctor Doom is most certainly at the heart of it. I'm also going to call it right now: I bet we get Avenger vs. X-men.  


Thanks for reading if you got this far. Cheers.

marvelstudios,How did Captain America actually return the Infinity Stones?,"I may be making something out of nothing but I really don't understand how he returned the Infinity Stones. I'm basing this whole thing on ""Return the stones to their own timeline, at the moment it was taken.""

Time Stone: Captain America went back in time and returned the infinity stones to their respective timelines to avoid screwing it up even further. That's okay and all but how exactly do you return the soul stone? Do you just leave it there? And wasn't the process of retrieving the soul stone sacrifice. ""A soul for a soul."" Can't that work in reverse? I mean, Natalie gave up her life for the stone so can you just return the soul stone and not get anything in return?

Space Stone: it's housed in the Tessaract. But when Cap is going back in time, it's just the stone. If he were to return it to the safe, how would he actually get it back into the Tessaract form? Wouldn't it be obvious that it's not in the Tessaract anymore?

Time Stone: easily returned to the Ancient One

Power Stone: it wasn't housed in the orb it was in prior to being taken back. He'd need to put it back in the orb.

Mind Stone: it was housed in the sceptre. Again, same problem. How would you return the mind stone minus the sceptre?

Reality Stone: I'm sure it'll be easy to just inject it back into Jane Foster. How hard can that be?

If chronologically, the stones were to be returned to the exact moment they were taken, Captain America would have succeeded in his tasks. Because the the stones would still be in that reality and time. But in returning the stones, he would have still created branched realities because the stones are not in the state they were originally in at the time of extraction. 
Steve had as much time as possible to return the stones but does that mean he took all the that time to individually place the stones back in their original housing then return them or just get them back to the their original timelines as they were in the case he was carrying them in?

And if the latter is true, how would that have affected the timeline?
Would Peter have found the Power Stone instead of the Orb?
Would S.H.I.E.L.D know what to do with the Space Stone?
What about the sceptre? Would it end up in the lab?
Would Malekith have the Aether?
And what will happen to the Soul Stone?

Since Miles parents would have spent more time working to stay afloat cause of the economical challenges Miles and his baby sister Billie (who’s actually from the comics) would spend most of their time with uncle Aaron, making the inevitable twist and death even more hard hitting.

The villain would be Hobgoblin, rhino (for the main action sequences), and partially uncle Aaron. I'd also want it to be really stylized, colorful, and tonally grounded similar to his original ultimate run and the final act of homecoming. He would start off with a more homemade suit inspired by the ITSV suit and by the end he would use uncle Aaron's old tech to make his classic suit. Also i'd add a cameo from the kangaroo just for gags

* The number 9 shows up quite emphatically more than once. This number has a symbolic meaning in some cultures, including, you guessed it, [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Norse_mythology#Nine)

* A Bible on top of a report on the Battle of New York

* [A poster that looks remarkably similar to the poster of the movie *Fantastic Planet*](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nwxjbz/always_watching_huh)

* A bunch of physics equations and diagrams about space and time (they seem legit, but I'm no expert)

* An astral map

* A weird diagram featuring a bunch of numbers (including the aforementioned 9, in bold emphasis). What caught my attention about this one is that it kind of reminded me of the [Freemasonry logo](https://images.app.goo.gl/nrsZs7ZQfk72oXeR6), but that's probably a stretch

marvelstudios,"Variant, Timelines, Loki, and Endgame","Loki being a variant has brought new elements into the discussion surrounding Steve Rogers' Endgame ending with Peggy, and I just wanted to share my understanding of things.

I always liked the Endgame writers' explanation (same timeline) thematically and felt it could be consistent with the time trav rules set out in Endgame, and doubly feel that is the case now with the TVA.

If it is an alt timeline, it also makes for some messy stuff with that Peggy... What about the Steve of that timeline? Did they wake him up? If so, isn't *that* the Steve that that Peggy is in love with? So wouldn't she rather be with her own timeline's Steve? Or did they form a thruple? Or did Prime Steve just leave himself in the ice?

I think Steve was in the principal timeline and was supposed to go back (according to the Timekeepers) and live with Peggy and was always in the background of the MCU. He let events unfold as they needed to because tampering with anything could undo their victory against Thanos, and if he didn't, the TVA would've come in and reset everything. He was *always* there in seclusion during the Infinity Saga, which is why his presence in the past didn't change anything; we already saw what the Infinity Saga looks like with a Old Man Steve in it. Otherwise, that timeline would've been considered a variant and would be destroyed, so the Sacred Timeline must account for a temporally displaced Steve Rogers.

Nothing else in Endgame outside of Loki necessarily makes a branch timeline, and if it did, it would probably feed fight back into the main one like a channel in a river without heading to the red. No reason the Ancient One couldn't have had that conversation with future hulk during Avengers 1. Steve vs Steve can be chalked up to Loki in disguise and a mind wipe at the end. TVA probably clipped Thanos 2014 timeline and his army was wiped by Avengers, so all good there. Gamora being displaced may be fine with TVA too since she isn't modifying the past. In fact, small branches and them being clipped may just be a regular feature of the sacred timeline. This explains Variant Looks existence. Yeah the Sacred Timeline Avengers create this variant but the TVA patches it like software devs by going in an resetting so it's all good.

Back to Cap, he returns all Infinity Stones, clipping those branches timelines. And then his life with Peggy was preordained by the Timekeepers because they know, in this timeline, he will retire and live that life Tony told him to get. He knows interference with anything whatsoever, Bucky, his frozen self, could fuck things up for the future Avengers against Thanos. He can't fuck with a sure victory when the stakes are that high.

My viewpoint on the TVA and the timelines is that it seems like entropy favors variation and branching of timelines, but the TVA are agents of order (perhaps the victors of the timeline (original Secret?) War. They see these branches as inevitable things that happen, and are like software devs going in and patching things. Their Sacred Timeline has the Avengers nesting Thanos, and even if that path creates some ""bugs"" (branches), they can just go in an ""patch"" (reset) it, no problem. Easier than rewriting the whole code (timeline).",1623378703,nx56p9

It was an entertaining show.  Breakfast Club Deke was awesome.  Framework was a powerful story.  The final season in general was fun.  Loved Quake and liked Fitzsimmons.  But the scale of the threats they regularly putdown, the methods employed and the lack of any cinematic Avengers or Avenger-adjacent superheros at all ever once participating (to list 3 of many reasons) makes it quite mad to think this show's events should be canon alongside the carefully constructed and planned out 13-year MCU.

marvelstudios,"""I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.""","The more I've sat with it, the more I've come to really enjoy the Loki premiere. While there was a lot of table setting to be done for the rest of the series, I think the pilot did a great job of examining and breaking Loki's self-image. One reason I found this particularly effective is that the episode largely deconstructed what I would call Loki's most notable quote (they even named the episode after it), and one of my favorite quotes in the entirety of the MCU: ""I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.""

Why do I love this line? Well, to start with, it's just a badass piece of dialogue. But more than that, the quote above gives the viewer an efficient look at precisely who Loki is as a character now that he's left Asgard in a few simple words. When introducing himself to a group of SHIELD agents, Loki wants the crowd to know two things: He's a god, and he's meant for greatness. Not only is he meant for it, he's **burdened** by it. In a delusional state of supreme egotism, the Avengers villain truly believes that it is his lot in life to rule, just as it's the lot of an ant to be crushed by a boot. He doesn't *want* to be Earth's king, he *has* to. In one line of dialogue, the viewers are reminded of Loki's ego, his power, and his delusions of grandeur.

So when approaching the character's first solo project, what do the writers do? They take one of Loki's most famous quotes and strip it down, proving its falsity to the god. Throughout the pilot, Loki is repeatedly shown just how truly insignificant he is. His godly powers are quaint. His precious gems have no use in the TVA. Asgardian gods aren't even the most powerful beings in the galaxy, let alone the universe. He was meant for defeat, he was meant to watch his loved ones perish, he was meant to fail time and time again, and, ultimately, he was meant to die at the hands of the Titan he thought he could overtake. This is how things were, it's how they are, and it's how they will always be. Loki of Asgard is not **burdened** with anything. His delusions of grandeur are just that: delusions.

We as viewers of course have seen Loki learn this lesson over the course of several films spanning nearly a decade. But this Loki, 2012 Loki, gets a trilogy of lessons and punishment served to him in a 45-minute beatdown of humility. So how are we starting a show about a character who has always felt like he's everything? According to the writers, we have him think, for the first time in his life, that he's **nothing**. He's yet another pawn on a chessboard when he was so proud to be winning checkers.

I think this is a genius way to start the series off on the right foot. For the first time as viewers, we get to see a Loki that's unsure of himself. By dissecting a familiar quote, the Loki creators have put the character in what appears to be unfamiliar terrain. I cannot wait to see where it goes.",1623373114,nx3gfb

marvelstudios,Loki Theory - The Plan for Phase Four,"I’ve seen a lot of people discussing how one of the time keepers looks like Kang and it got me thinking. What if Kang has already conquered the multiverse and is secretly using the TVA to maintain control of it?

My theory goes as follows:

The multiversal war referenced by Miss Minutes was actual Kang’s original conquest of the multiverse, which ended with Kang himself creating the TVA and enforcing the sacred timeline as a way of controlling all of reality under the guise of protection. So at this point in the MCU, Kang has already conquered the multiverse and is secretly using the TVA to maintain control by pruning (destroying) any possible branched realities. If at the end of Loki the multiverse breaks open and becomes too out of control for the TVA to handle then Kang may appear in future movies (like Ant-Man) as a friend who claims to want to restore “order” to the multiverse. But then eventually his and the TVA’s true intentions will be revealed and after the heroes realize the actual implications of destroying entire alternate realities and the motives of their “allies” they will turn on each other and the Avengers will fight to protect the multiverse while Kang fights to destroy it and restore his “sacred timeline”.",1623370794,nx2pow

marvelstudios,Opinion: The real villain in Loki is (spoilers inside),"The real villain is the TVA.  So, we have three all-powerful creatures that created this agency to stop a second multiverse war...great.  Sounds good on the surface.  But look at what they are doing. Thanos liked to talk about strong willpower, but these creatures are completely stopping willpower, for all living things, in millions of universes.  They are forcing every single living thing to live a predetermined destiny without any say-so or choice. Why? Their vision of a ""sacred timeline"".  What they think is perfect. They just execute people, and the universes their independent choices made, with impunity. To them, the trillions of lifeforms created from the birth of a new universe aren't even real, in a way. They ARE a rolling multiverse war, slaughter untold numbers for the sake of their ""peace"".  There are literally infinite numbers of potential universes, and they are slaughtering them.  Mobius literally comforts a child, says the devil/Mephisto is afraid of them, tells her to go outside, *then orders the destruction of her universe without a flinch.* The only reason they want Loki is to stop another him/her that's made a 500 year old timeline and evaded them.  They're authoritarians forcing their will on all living things in the multiverse, not just a single universe. Look at the posters behind him in the ticket scene. A big brother eye on the left and on the right the cartoon clock with ""Behave!"". Like propaganda. And who is to say another multiverse war is inevitable? Lots of failures thought they were inevitable and knew it all.  Thanos was a grand villain for destroying just half of the life in a universe, but the timekeepers snuff out entire universes, planets, stars and all, on the daily with ease. Older, villain Loki is the bluff. The TVA is the real villain.

""The first and most impressive lie ever uttered was the song of freedom.  For nearly every living thing, choice breeds shame and uncertainty and regret. There's a fork in every road, yet the wrong path always taken."" - Loki",1623369749,nx2cz0

marvelstudios,"Thanos accessing the ""Infinite Loop"" in IW is the Nexus Event Strange saw. What he did with the Time stone helped create the winning timeline that's mentioned in 'Loki' - culminating in Kang's appearance in Quantumania.","When Thanos acquired the Mind stone in Wakanda from Vision and snapped his fingers, this became a ""Nexus Event"" - which Doctor Strange saw. My belief has always been that Strange cast a spell on the Time stone before Thanos arrived on Titan, a spell on the Time stone which adhered to the Avengers winning timeline - the ""Sacred Timeline"" - so once the Time stone was connected with the other Infinity stones in the gauntlet &amp; formed the Infinite Loop &amp; Thanos snapped his fingers, the spell's effects would ripple across all of space &amp; time to ensure all the events leading up to that point and beyond would be part of the winning outcome for the Avengers and the Sacred timeline. But then this begs the question on why the TVA would allow this. My theory is that they didn't exist yet, not until Thanos destroyed the Infinity stones. As the Ancient One explained the flow of time being controlled by the Infinity stones, once Thanos destroyed the stones(*becoming a 2nd Nexus Event*), the multiverse/branching realities came into being. We can assume the birth of the TVA came from that point I guess. 

Plus, why are all the TVA staff humans? I think it's because of Thanos accessing the Infinite Loop on Earth, making it  Nexus Point in the Universe, which is why all the baddies seem to be interested in Earth(*Asgardians ruled it as Midgard, Dormammu's hunger for Earth, the Vibranium meteor in Wakanda, 2 or 3 Infinity stones being on Earth for a long time*).

I think Multiverse of Madness will address this, with the MCU Earth being the Nexus Point in everything, with Time Vortices opening up in *Spiderman: No Way Home* pulling in different villains from alternate timelines/realities. And Kang's appearance in *Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania* means he's attacking the Sacred Timeline from the Quantum Realm - and my speculation is that the TVA headquarters is in the Quantum Realm. Kang is coming for Janet Van Dyne and her knowledge about the Quantum Realm and the quantum healing particles - which could be what the TVA is using in those time grenades to help reset the timeline - Kang is locked out of the Sacred Timeline and needs the Quantum healing particles to get back into the Sacred timeline and keep the TVA off of his back.",1623369149,nx25ke

marvelstudios,The issue of 'Agents of SHIELD',"This morning, [Decider.com](https://Decider.com) posted an article titled: [‘Loki’ is the Perfect Opportunity to Finally Erase ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’](https://decider.com/2021/06/10/loki-erase-agents-of-shield/) This has been a point of contention for years and I wanted to see what others think of the problem. Some consider it canon, others don't. Others do but *wish* it wasn't...

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts:

I don't consider myself a superfan of any franchise, but I enjoy Marvel films as anyone else does. To that point, I was disappointed when Agents of SHIELD started to drift away from the standard MCU and further concerned with the prospect of it being removed entirely.

I recognize some didn't like the style of the show, writing, etc. but I'm worried a larger point is being overlooked. To my knowledge, the show was the only instance in which the MCU allows the heroes to be normal people, whose only superpower is their dedication and service to the greater good. Agents of SHIELD was almost an ode to the idea of service to others (see the episode 'A Spy's Goodbye' for a great demonstration of my point).

Especially now, when politics are so divisive, the one thing I think brings everyone together is the concept that when ordinary individuals collaborate for the advancement of shared values they don't need superpowers to do great things.

Even those characters who earn/engineer their powers rely on the premise that they are special or unique against the otherwise boring people around them. I think that premise should and must be challenged. Simply put: being unique and special is great! But let's recognize the everyday people who still do extraordinary things.

**The preservation of Agents of SHIELD in MCU proper is not just preserving the stories of an admittedly flawed show, but defending the principles it embodied.** Principles, that I hope will make their way into more Marvel Studios projects.

Plot twist: Evil Loki from Past is this same Loki in the future. By destroying the TVA, there is no more control of the sacred timeline anymore.

Because there is no time in the TVA, Loki was the one that caused the multiverse war to begin with,  by giving birth to it and, by doing this, he ensured the creation of the TVA and the loop repeats itself.

Loki do this every loop because it's the only way to escape death by Thanos and the Time Keepers.

marvelstudios,(Discussion) The bazillion time-travel and timeline questions created by Loki and the TVA,"**Important:** I know the real answer to all of this is ""We don't have to think that much about it."", but l let's have some fun. I'd like to read some theories!

So, after Endgame I think we can all more or less agree that we thought that we had the main MCU timeline, and then branching timelines created by the time heist.

Some examples:

- A timeline branching from 2012 where Cap fought himself and Loki escaped with the Tesseract.

- A timeline branching from 2014 where Thanos and his army travelled to the 2023 of another timeline and never came back. So basically a branch that had no Thanos since 2014.

--- 

And then comes Loki and the TVA. Oh my...

So, apparently the TVA makes sure there is **ONLY ONE TIMELINE, the ""Sacred Timeline""**. Just that one, which is confirmed is (duh) it's the main MCU timeline we've been watching all along. Sometimes, something happens that it's not supposed to happen, creating a branch that the TVA quickly resets with those small devices they plant on the floor. That seems to erase all divergences in order to only have the Sacred Timeline.

Now... some questions:

- What does this mean for the branching timelines created in Endgame? Were they erased soon after?

- And if they were erased, then how did Captain America return the infinity stones? He went to return them to those branching timelines so...

- The TVA confirms that the time heist had to happen, that means that the creation of those branching timelines had to happen too. What then? Do they erase them or let them exist? Because letting them exist would be against all they work for. The only think I can think of is that they wait for Captain to return the stones, then they erase it. That, or maybe the TVA explained the erasing of the timelines to Cap and he never told anybody (doubt it though).

- The time heist was supposed to happen, but Loki stealing the Tesseract was **not** supposed to happen? Then what was supposed to happen? That the Avengers got the Tesseract in 2012 and then went back with it to 2023 instead of Tony and Steve travelling further back in time to steal it?

- But Tony and Steve DID travel back further in time. That DID happen, in the Sacred Timeline, so shouldn't it be what was supposed to happen all along? But it only happen because Loki stole the Tesseract (which wasn't supposed to happen). So is this a divergence of the time heist that the TVA allowed?

- And if the TVA reset the timeline created with Loki escaping with the Tesseract, then what did they exactly reset? Loki not escaping? The time heist part of 2012? Did the reset have any effect on the time heist then? And if it didnt, then why not?

- What about Cap deciding to spend his life with Peggy? That means he spent a few decades in a timeline that was different from the Sacred Timeline, so there was a braching timeline that at least existed for a few decades. Did the TVA allow it and then erase it?

Anyway, it's all a bit of a mindfuck and I can't think of a clear answer other than the TVA erasing the branching timelines once they ""serve their purpose"" but not before, and also allowing some divergences like the time heist not happening exactly like it was supposed to happen.

marvelstudios,What do you guys think they meant by this?,"Let's look at what happened this way: Loki gets the Tesseract and escapes into the desert. They capture Loki and the Tesseract and reset/prune that timeline.

Are the Avengers still looking for the missing original Loki and the Tesseract? Or it resets to a point where the Tesseract are still in the case? But what about the events that led the case to Loki? 

Maybe they prune it to the point where the future Avengers were not even there, since they will go further into the past for another Tesseract? If so, they also have reseted the Avengers' attempt and technically killed that version of them.

marvelstudios,Loki's Glorious Purpose,"I think we can already see where this is going (and from the line of questioning, I wonder if Agent Mobius also sees it). Why? Why does Loki want to rule? He says it's his Glorious Purpose, but that doesn't answer the WHY question. I think he realizes this himself by the end. Why does he want to rule? Because, when you get to the core of it all Loki seethes at being secondary. He doesn't want to be Thor's younger brother. He doesn't want to be Thanos' puppet. If he can rule, then he can be in control and have that most precious gift: freedom. And yet, by the end of Episode 1 he has to accept that no matter what happens, even if he were to escape, flee to another planet, flee to another time, find somewhere to rule... it will always be at the mercy of the TVA. These people nullify Infinity Stones and turn them to paperweights. There is literally nothing that he can do, he can never escape such power. And yet, the fact that he exists at all is proof that he is in the Sacred Timeline. He must have a purpose yet to play, a role in the Sacred Timeline or else the TVA would have simply come back, pruned this branch and nullified him in a ""Well, that didn't work out after all"" kind of way. He is in the Sacred Timeline, and whatever he does is what is SUPPOSED to have happened. Why is the Sacred Timeline the only one that is SUPOSED to happen? Because it is the one that leads to the creation of the TVA. Since the TVA exists, it must therefore exist. Any branch that could compete with the Sacred Timeline must be pruned, in order for the TVA to come into being, in order to prune the branches in order to come into being in order to... you get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter what else happens along the way, Loki now knows that only three beings in the entirety of existence have ever had any true freedom. Not Thanos, not Odin, not even the TVA itself. The three ""Space Lizards"" control the flow of time, and they are the only beings with the ability to control their own destiny. We never actually SAW the three Time Keepers, and even the cartoon representation of them shows three clearly different species. If Loki truly wants freedom, and to rule... he has to destroy the Time Keepers or become one of them. But, even the Time Keepers did not always rule. There was a multiversal war first, and then the Time Keepers ""Brought peace by reorganizing the multiverse into a single timeline."" So, therefore at some point in time there is/was a multiverse (according to Hulk Banner's speech). Much like the Missouri River, Tennessee River, Ohio River, etc that eventually all flow into the Mississippi River and become part of it. Branches OFF the Sacred Timeline must be pruned, but branches INTO the Sacred Timeline are what is supposed to happen. Who is to say at what point in time this show is taking place? Maybe Loki is in the 4,000,000,000th year AD? Or even BC? The point is that at SOME POINT within the Sacred Timeline, there exist merges much like a confluence of rivers. Before there can be a Sacred Timeline there must first be a multiversal war, followed by confluences of multiverses which are created by the Time Keepers. If you want to find/become a Time Keeper, that's where you have to start.

1) Does the Ancient One have no knowledge of the TVA despite her mastery of different dimensions? Maybe the darkness she refers to is being pruned but it's vague.

2) The stones in Endgame obviously work - why? I suspect possibly because they haven't been moved to a different reality but a future, but maybe because their reality still exists. Perhaps the ones in Loki are remnants from 'pruned' timelines which is why they have no power.

So far, all we've gotten is Evan Peters cameo in Wanda Vision which later turned out to be a belittling cruel joke by Marvel towards the x-men fans, as it turns out Evan's role was not quicksilver from the Fox's X-Men universe.

How long do we have to wait? Disney has the time and the resources to easily introduce the first chapter to reintroducing x-men into the MCU. I just dont understand the logic behind not doing so now and having to wait it out indefinitely.

marvelstudios,Theory: The Avengers weren’t the only ones travelling through time in 2012 [Loki Spoilers],"&gt;!What got me thinking about this was that the Avengers travelling through time WAS supposed to happen but Loki escaping with the Tesseract WASN'T. Now this isn’t possible without creating some kind of a paradox. Since Avengers time travelling played out the same way everytime (or them travelling through time was part of the sacred timeline), we shouldn’t have a variant in this specific timeline. If the Avengers travelling to 2012 supposed to happen, then Loki escaping also supposed to happen BECAUSE the Avengers going back to 2012 resulted in Loki's escape.!&lt;

If Loki wasn’t supposed to escape, then that means the tesseract wasn’t supposed to get kicked to Loki, or the suitcase wasn't supposed to get dropped by Tony or Tony wasn’t supposed get thrown away by Hulk or Hulk wasn’t supposed to take the stairs and it goes on. So you get the point. If somebody HAD to be a variant, it shouldn’t be Loki. This also tackles on the topics of free will, predestination and foreknowledge but I don’t wanna go there (and some even theorised the TVA are the antagonist because they are taking away the free will of others or serving their own benefits).

So, in short, either both the Avengers time travelling and Loki escaping were supposed to happen, or neither of them were supposed to happen. UNLESS. Unless, there was another time traveller, a variant, who went to 2012 and messed up something, which as a domino/buttetfly effect, resulted in Loki escaping. This is the ONLY option I can find right now that doesn’t result in a paradox in 2012. Now I want to note that this doesn’t explain why the TVA chose to capture Loki, but it does explain how Loki escaped in the first place.

Now who could be that mystery time traveller? I'm thinking either Kang or Lady Loki. I'm leading more towards Lady Loki, I think Lady Loki knows about the TVA and considers them evil and she wants Loki's help to destroy burn them down. Why didn't she just travel to Loki and tell him directly? Well then he's gotta experience the TVA firsthand otherwise he'll think she's just bluffing and the only way she could do it is by messing something up in 2012 and causing Loki to get recognized as a variant and get captured by the TVA. And for the ending, I'm thinking they will team up in the end, and the final battle will be Loki+Lady Loki+Mobius vs the TVA or Loki+Lady Loki vs Mobius+TVA.

marvelstudios,Questions about End Game,"Last night drunk me decided to watch End Game for the second time, first being in theaters. 

Yes, it had its moments that pulled on your heart strings.. Tony and Thor meeting their parent, the conversation between the Hulk and that bald chick that resulted in her handing over the time stone, everyone in the MCU coming together for an epic fight against Thanos, seeing a relatable PTSD Thor, seeing Iron Man and Cap on the same wavelength (when they were discussing their new plan after losing the Tesseract), and of course, Cap picking up mjolnir. 

However, aside from all that I still believe this movie should not have happened since (1) the ending to Infinity War was so perfect even though the bad guy won and (2) to me time travel is such a loophole to change the direction of a movie to wherever you want, like a giant undo button. 

But coming back from my rant, there are some questions I was hoping you guys could answer. 

(1) If Thor was his old self, not the fatty we see, could he have snapped his fingers instead of the Hulk or would it still be too much for him? 

(2) How did no one care that Cap was holding  mjolnir? Especially after Ultron, when all the Avengers tried and failed to pick it up, at least some of the heroes should have been like “Wtf is this mf really holding that hammer? How?!!” 

(3) I can’t remember, but of course I will as soon as I post this.",1623355517,nwx2rh

Everyone I've talked to up until this point has no idea what I'm talking about, but I know I'm not making this up or remembering it wrong.
I saw Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in theaters the week it came out, and watched it again when it came to streaming however many months later that was. Between its theatrical release and streaming release, they changed the order of the songs. 
In the version I saw in theaters, the song playing while Ego and Meredith are driving down the country road at the beginning of the movie wasn't Brandy, it was Lake Shore Drive. Then when the Guardians were leaving Sovereign, it wasn't Lake Shore Drive that played, but a reprise of Mr. Blue Sky. Brandy didn't play until Ego turned on the tape player right before the climax and did his monologue.

marvelstudios,Theory: The TVA Always Fails,"As the 10th Doctor says, time is ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey.""

The TVA exists outside of time but is always beholden to it. 

The TVA is created because of a Multiverse War which leads to a desire to protect the ""Sacred Timeline"" after the war. 

The TVA fails protecting the Sacred Timeline due to a Loki Variant (whether or not it's the same one we're watching's future or another Variant is irrelevant). 

By failing to protect the Sacred Timeline and the destruction of the TVA, the Multiverse is ""free"" and free will ""returns.""

But because of ""wibbly wobbly timey wimey"" the TVA always fails and is always created because the Multiverse War starts when more timelines and multiverses are created.

The TVA insist that they need to fix alternate timelines...

...so how does that explain Steve opening a new one so he can see Peggy?

As Joe Russo said:

*“Based on everything that happened, he would have been in a branch reality and then had to have shifted over to this, so jumped from one to the other and handed the shield off… One thing that’s clear that Anthony and I have discussed, I don’t know that we’ve discussed this publicly at all, Cap would have had to have travelled back to the main timeline. That’s something that, yes, he would have been in a branch reality, but he would have to travel back to the main timeline to give that shield to Sam Wilson.”*",1623353604,nwwbcl
marvelstudios,"Why Loki's escape wasn't supposed to happen, even though the Time Heist was [Warning: Far-Fetched Crackpot Conspiracy Theory]"," If the Sacred (read: main) Timeline is anything like ours, all effects stem from causes in the timeline, obviously. Tony getting shrapnel to the heart leads to him becoming Iron Man, Dr. Erskine choosing Steve for the serum leads to Red Skull's defeat, Loki falling from Asgard leads to The Avengers, and so on. You could argue that if you knew literally everything in the present, you could predict the future with 100% accuracy; in fact, *Laplace's Demon* posits this very idea, and it aligns with how the TVA think.

In this scenario, parallel realities opened due to the Time Heist wouldn't be seen as an issue, as they were guaranteed; the events that led to Thanos' victory were guaranteed, and the Time Heist that resulted from that cause would be as inevitable as Thanos. If you flip a coin, there isn't a parallel universe where it lands heads and where it lands tails; the result was set in stone before you even flipped the coin. Those alternate timelines were always certain to be created by the Time Heist, and as such aren't the TVA's concern. Maybe they ""prune"" (which I'm pretty sure means they obliterate the timeline and everyone on it) a few loose ends, but it's nothing out of the ordinary.

So why does Loki's escape not fit in to this? Shouldn't it have been part of the natural sequence of events? Well, what if a series of events didn't stem from causes in that timeline? What if a series of events were, in fact, their *own* causes? I'm talking about the Bootstrap Paradox; the scenario where some event causes some sequence of events to happen to cause the starting event to happen in the first place. Such an event wouldn't be guaranteed, and as such would catch the TVA's attention. It would be an unforeseen anomaly, an alteration to the guaranteed timeline.

Knowing that, consider the events leading to Loki's escape in the first place. He got ahold of the Tessaract, which was knocked away from Tony, because Hulk slammed the door in his face. All part of the normal sequence of guaranteed events.

...Or is it?

Think about it. In the normal 2012, Tony wouldn't have had an Ant-man induced heart attack. He'd simply be arguing with the Hydra dude, before being interrupted by Hulk. So why didn't Time Heist Tony remember that would happen? You'd think he'd at least stay a bit away from the door if he remembered a suddenly yelling Hulk while he was arguing, scaring off a dozen people and making a scene. It could be that he forgot. Or it could be that Hulk slamming the door didn't actually happen in the main timeline. What if something, or some*one*, made sure that Hulk would slam the door and ensure Loki would escape? Someone, who, say, has a history of manipulating minds and tricking others into doing their bidding?

What if the Loki that's been killing Minutemen (we'll call him Evil Loki) ensured that Loki (we'll call him Protag Loki) escaped? This has a number of consequences- namely, the creation of the 1970 timeline. And since Steve stayed there to be with Peggy, there's no telling how that timeline changed. If, say, he rescued 1970 Steve from the ice, Captain America might not be in the Avengers. I doubt Steve would be content sitting in the sidelines knowing what he knows. What if the changes Steve made to the 1970 timeline led to the creation of Evil Loki? And Evil Loki then ensured that Protag Loki would escape? Maybe he was hunted by the TVA for causing an unforseen Bootstrap Paradox, which is why he knows about them when no one else does. It's far fetched, but I'm still confident at least some parts of my theory are correct. I'm at least hoping we see Steve returning the stones in Loki.

TL:DR; Evil Loki gets Hulk to slam the door on Tony, leading to Protagonist Loki's escape, the 1970 timeline, and the rise of Evil Loki himself. This unexpected Bootstrap Paradox pisses off the TVA, leading to Evil Loki learning about them, then killing them with hidden flamethrowers while disguised as Mephisto to drive fans insane in real life, or something like that.

marvelstudios,Is the TVA actually The Council of Loki’s?,"Loki is obsessed with power. He feels the need to be the most powerful one in the room. When the TVA picks him up, it doesn’t take long for him to realize they are the greatest power in the universe - they are using infinity stones as paperweights! The idea of this much power immediately draws him in and in true Loki fashion, he’s trying to figure out how he can become the ruler of the TVA. 
Early in the show, we see a file that states his gender is fluid, and we know he is capable of changing his appearance. 
I’m thinking the TVA are all Loki’s, sort of like the Council of Rick, and they were founded BY Loki, after he traveled back in time to create them.
When our Loki asks about speaking to the time-keepers, he uses the term “gods to gods”, like LOKI TO LOKI (wink wink nudge nudge)
 He created the TVA, so the TVA would arrest him, so he could learn about their power and create them, like a paradox. They exist because the other exists, and it’s just a big time loop. Kind of like a MOBIUS STRIP (Mobius his partner, wink wink nudge nudge). 
I don’t know know what the deal is with the Loki variant they are chasing, or how that will fit in the story, but there’s something fishy going on with the TVA and it seems fitting that the God of Mischief would be behind it. Could Loki be back as the top villain of the MCU?",1623351288,nwvdtw

marvelstudios,"After watching Loki episode 1, I have some questions","The judge in the TVA said that the Avengers time travelling was supposed to happen but Loki escaping wasn't. 


But yet the TVA reset branched timelines in order to prevent a so-called ""multiversal war"" so why was the Avengers time travelling supposed to happen? The Avengers by even being in 2012 new York changed events from the sacred timeline. For one, Cap fought himself, he pretended to be a member of hydra, the hulk met the ancient one, ant-man pulled Stark's heart pin etc. All these events didn't occur in the original sacred timeline, so why does the TVA say it was supposed to happen? It still creates a branch, a pretty significant one, even if Loki hadn't escaped.

The same can be said about the branched timeline that involved Thanos and his armies disappearing in 2014 and the timeline that Cap lived in with Peggy and the timeline where 2013 Thor suddenly has Mjolnir get pulled from his hand by 2023 Thor. 

These to me, all seem like branched timelines so why has the TVA just allowed it?

Also when the TVA reset a given timeline, how do you think it's done? For example, branched 2012 was ""reset"" when they found Loki so do you think they reset it to just before Stark got knocked over by Hulk or what? If the 2012 branched timeline was truly reset and erased then does that mean Steve can't return the Time stone and mind stone?",1623347167,nwtpzr

Here me out, this all seems far fetched.

Ravonna Renslayer is Kang's wife in the comics. She is (probably) ALREADY Kang's wife here. She is the judge that judged Loki as guilty. 

The middle timekeeper IS Kang. It's symbolic that he is seen above Ravonna, and he also looks similar to the comic counterpart.

Now, why would Kang lie about this? In the comics, he wants to rule the universe, but since his time isn't a good place to conquer, he goes back to the present. He does not want anyone else doing this besides himself.

Extra Evidence:

They literally zoom in on the middle timekeeper at the very end. They're hinting at something.

The Miss Minutes explanation was also very much propaganda by the TVA themselves.

Mobius is only excited to see Loki because he knows he can use him to catch Lady Loki and end this.

The death of his mother and helping Thor in the Dark World, Ragnarok and dealing with Hela, betraying Thanos (Might have missed something)

So I'm guessing he'll have to be wiped and return or this whole timeline is screwed, the continuity for the films we watched wouldn't happen like it does.

marvelstudios,Loki’s Temporal Aura,"I don’t know if anyone’s done this yet and i’m no expert, I just got my temporal aura taken and read twice. Loki’s aura is interesting though because at the shop that took my photo they read it in a very linear time sense. Usually the colors on the left side are for last week, the colors on top are for this week, and the colors on the right are for next week. Considering the colors are bent like a rainbow across the whole photo I would assume a reading for that photo means his aura reflects the same emotions and energy throughout that three week timeline, possible representation for him being outside of any timeline because he’s going through all of this in a liminal space? The colors in itself are pretty easy to interpret, and I’d love to hear everyone else’s interpretation of the colors, but another prominent aspect of aura photos are the murkiness of areas of the body. If a part of the body is murky or lacks color that means there’s turmoil and stress in that area, and in loki’s, his head is the only area without color. Clearly some confusion in the moment, but foreshadowing for something else? Is that not our same loki to his knowledge? Robot loki? Idk, thought I’d share my own insight from experience.

I say this because, yes, changes did happen in the timeline(s) BUT maybe a specific timeline(s) didn’t have such an outstanding/overarching change to where after a butterfly effect had occurred it would ultimately still fork back into the main timeline.

marvelstudios,Do you think Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch will have trouble with the Time Variance Authority?,"Yesterday I saw the first episode of Loki on Disney+ and in that episode came one important detail being the explanation of who the TVA (Time Variance Authority) are and what they do. 

The TVA (as Miss Minutes puts it) are basically these special officers that arrest people aka variants who break the sacred timeline by veering off into a different path that could potentially create a chaotic situation known as the multiverse. 

We know for a fact that the sequel to Doctor Strange will be called “In The Multiverse of Madness” and Scarlet Witch will be in the movie too in which leads me to my theory. 

In the post credit scene of WandaVision, we see Wanda reading a book and practicing spells to eventually become the Scarlet Witch until suddenly, she hears a cry for help. Those voices being none other than her kids Billy (Wiccan) and Tommy (Speed). 

She then asks Doctor Strange to help him save her children but he says no because it could lead to dire consequences. But Wanda ignores his advice and breaks the rules somehow and Doctor Strange has no other choice but to prevent her rescue mission from coming to fruition. How America Chavez comes along, I really don’t know how but we’ll see I guess.

Anyway the point in what I’m saying is that the next movie after Spider-Man: No Way Home is called Doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness. Which makes me wonder, could the two characters come face to face with the TVA during the events of the movie and maybe event meet The Timekeepers all because Wanda wanted to save her sons or am I overthinking too much for a film I haven’t even seen yet?",1623340201,nwqxuo

What took me out of it is that is was the same shots we previously saw in MCU films, so my mind immediatly thought: How did they get this footage",1623339874,nwqt97
marvelstudios,So about the first episode of Loki. If….. then what about…. In MoM,"In the first episode of Loki they basically say that all multiverses are condensed to a single timeline.  This means that every multiverse is just the same which means that it’s essentially still a universe right?  So unless somethings messed up then what does that mean for dr strange multiverse of madness?  I was under the impression there would be all sorts of different universes but at least from the first episode they are saying differently.

Somethings not adding up",1623339590,nwqp7z
marvelstudios,Interesting detail about Loki and Frigga,"In Endgame, Frigga instantly knew that Thor was a time traveler, and the same happened with Loki, as he instantly knew Tony was a time traveler too.
Like mother, like son.",1623339481,nwqnpo
