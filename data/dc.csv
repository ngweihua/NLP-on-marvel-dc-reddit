DC_Cinematic,OTHER: Where can I stream/rent THE DARK KNIGHT so that it changes aspect ratios for the IMAX scenes?,"Hi everyone! I was planning to watch THE DARK KNIGHT tonight on Hulu (in the U.S.), but noticed that their version doesn’t feature an expanded aspect ratio for the scenes filmed in IMAX (such as the bank heist).

Assuming that HBO Max switches ratios (I know that the Ultimate Edition of BvS), does anyone know which services allow me to stream or rent TDK with the IMAX scenes in full?

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: To those still Streaming ZSJL weekly to help numbers......,"The thing you should all be doing is switching to the cheaper HBO Max.

The Ad revenue towards that movie will begin to speak for itself.

If you are paying full price you give them an extra 5$ a month, but they would earn much more than that from you running ads around ZSJL.

Those that buy ad space would be pushing to place their ads on the Movies/ TV shows with the most views and revenue.


In theory it is a better ploy than running the normal subscription at 15$ a month where it counts that you watched it again, but it likely isn't giving the same impact as hundreds of thousands of ads getting played for this film, or this film receiving much more Ads played than others.",1623952206,o236we

DC_Cinematic,MERCHANDISE: About a US 4K/Blu-ray/DVD release Zack Snyder's Justice League,"Everything proceeding refers to Warner Bros exclusively, other studios may do things differently.

In the US, the typical span of time for a theatrical release to make it to home media is around four months. This has not changed with WB's Theatrical and Streaming plan (*Godzilla vs Kong* hit theaters in March, Blu-ray came out in this week, *Mortal Kombat* was April, Blu-ray comes out in July, etc.). Following this pattern *ZSJL* should have come to home media this month. That's because it isn't a theatrical film, it's an HBOMax original, which makes it like a TV series physical media wise.

For TV shows, Warner Bros doesn't put out seasons or series until closer to a new season, or six months after concluding. This can be seen by looking at the release dates for seasons of CW shows and comparing them with their following seasons, which are typically 2-3 months out at the time of release, and by looking at the dates for the final episode of a miniseries (like *Watchmen*, *Castle Rock*, *11.22.63*, etc.) and their physical media releases.

There are exceptions to this; the first season of *His Dark Materials* did not come out until eight months after it concluded, and *Lovecraft Country* came out a mere four months after it's season ended. By and large however the pattern is there that it takes around six months for a show or miniseries from Warner Bros to make it to physical media in the US. However as with most things one should not look at the exceptions as a reason to expect something different to happen this time around.

Keeping all of this in mind I wouldn't expect to get an announcement for a stateside release until later in July (for an August release) or August (for a September release). Regardless of when it comes out though, one thing is certain; it *will* come out. Warner Bros has been very good about giving their DC properties physical releases.

**TLDR:** Zack Snyder's Justice League most likely won't hit US shelves until August/September.",1623950516,o22is3

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: That death at the end of Batman v Superman...,"To confess, when I watched Batman v Superman (The ultimate edition), I ended up crying at the moment Superman sacrificed himself. At first, I thought it was only because of Hans Zimmer's emotional score, which was amazing as always. But when I thought about it further, I ended up finding another reason upon rewatches.

From the exact moment he got stabbed, that wasn't Superman screaming. Because the Kryptonite spear took away his invulnerability. **That was Clark Kent.** A journalist who sought the truth in a more paranoid world. A humble man who found happiness with a woman he loved and the parents who raised him. But most importantly, someone who powered through untold levels of pain, through *sheer will*, to eliminate an monster that was threatening his world. *For the second time.*

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Just saw Superman III for the first time ever.,"I had seen bits and pieces of this movie over the years on YouTube and heard it was bad but I didn’t think it was this bad.

Lois was barely in this movie, she probably had 5 minutes worth of screen time total, absolute disappointment. After Superman II when Clark erased Lois mind and backtracked their relationship, I was hoping to see it rebuild this movie. Was the actress busy filming another movie or something because her role was so incredibly small. 

Also is Lana going to be the new love interest in Superman IV? The movie seems to set Clark and Lana up as a potential couple?

Gus was just so incredibly smart for some reason and it was never really explained. Gus was portrayed to be an ordinary guy at the beginning but all of sudden becomes a 1000 iq hacker? The dude could just casually blueprinted the world’s most advance supercomputer in a few weeks but is struggling to find employment?

Also, the logic in this movie was ridiculous. If you could just hack good enough, a satellite designed to monitor weather will be able to control it instead. I know it’s a superhero movie but the first Superman movie was reasonable enough for me to believe.

The main villain was forgettable and a discount Hackman.

Finally, this movie literally pulled a reverse-WW84. The villains managed to change Superman’s personality and one of them seduced Superman and convinces him to rip a hole in an oil tanker. After that, she fucks Superman and later in the film, Superman seems to have no recollection of this at all and implies that evil Superman was a separate personality. That was a huge wtf moment for me.

Next sure if I should watch Superman IV. Will Lois have more screen time next film? Is the plot a little tighter?

I’m interested because I thought Jon Cryer was a brilliant Lex on Supergirl and know he plays Lenny Luthor in next film.",1623719949,o025ao

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: the Amazon/Steppenwolf introduction was full of throwbacks to 300,"This might be speculation on my part, but did anyone else feel that the Amazon/Steppenwolf introduction in Zack Snyder's Justice League contained numerous throwbacks to Snyder's famous Spartan action flick 300? It wouldn't be the first-time he's done meta homages.

First, there's the aesthetics: Hippolyta's helmet looks just like Leonidas's, and the Amazons have exposed 6-pack abs like the spartans.

Then there's the dialogue- Steppenwolf threatening the Amazons with divine dialogue was similar to Xerxes and co. threatening the Spartans. And of course, the Amazonian response of ""we have no fear"" evoked the Spartan yells.

Finally, during the battle itself, we see the Amazons doing spear thrusts into the parademons, much like the Spartans did to the Persians during the first encounter.

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Two neat story parallels in The Dark Knight Rises.,"1. Bane and Talia al Ghul were prisoners their whole lives- in The Pit, to The League of Shadows, their anger and disillusionment with the world and most importantly their thirst for vengeance. Bane's desire to succeed Ra's al Ghul and resentment for Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Talia's desire to see Gotham burn clouded their vision. Unlike them and their blind followers- the League and the citizens of Gotham who gave into their cause- Bruce Wayne persevered partly because he embraced his fear and anger for righteousness rather than drowning in it. 

2. The League of Shadows built up their cause by infecting Gotham from the inside- their foundation underneath Wayne Enterprises (also through Talia working undercover as Miranda Tate so she knew where Bruce's armory and reactor was), and indoctrinating a lot of the needy and desperate- those who were ""cast out into the cold world that we know and endure"". They gradually rise up from the underground and trade places on the surface with the Gotham City police- those who were seen as oppressors due to The Dent Act end up underground, then they eventually rise back out and take back Gotham. This time they're redeemed by saving the good civilians who steered from Bane's cause from complete annihilation (one clear example being Peter Foely who goes from a cowardly and power-hungry tyrant to selflessly laying down his life), and Batman's act of courageousness makes way for a hopeful future compared to the faux one that Bane, a false prophet in retrospect, propped up.",1623649567,nzftl8

DC_Cinematic,OTHER: Why Injustice animated movie doesn’t make sense,"Ever since it was announced I’ve been wondering how exactly a single animated movie would work for injustice. Cause there’s so much to cover. There’s 2 games. About 192 comic issues explaining the first first game alone. 36 issues set between the first and second game. And a cross over/sequel to the second game involving masters of the universe.

That’s just too much source material for 1 movie. Unless it only covers the first game. Which it probably will. But it’ll have some plot holes to people unaware of the story. The comic story also follows 5 years. And I don’t think you can fit more then 1 year in a movie.

So this is how I would do it:

Movie 1: ground zero comic

Movie 2: comics year 1

Movie 3: comics year 2

Movie 4: comics year 3

Movie 5: comics year 4

Movie 6: comics year 5

Movie 7: first game 

Movie 8: injustice 2 comics 

Movie 9 injustice 2 game 

Movie 10: injustice vs masters of the universe

There’s also year zero comics but I’m not really sure where they take place in the story. So yeah I think 10 animated movies would do the story justice.",1623604500,nz12u8

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: The one thing that I hate about Birds Of Prey,"So I just watched birds of prey for the second time and I really did enjoy it. It’s funny, it introduced some cool characters, the fight scenes were pretty cool, but there’s just one thing that I’ll never like about that movie. Cassandra Cain. She just wasn’t rlly the character we know her as. If she had been named something else in the movie, I would’ve been fine with that, but in the comics, she is a total badass who has been trained her whole life and then becomes an awesome hero. In this movie, the only badass thing she did was blow up Black Mask lol. I just hope that one day we can get the real Cassandra Cain that we all know from the comics on the big screen!",1623389082,nx87i4
DC_Cinematic,Am I the only person that isn't a fan of Snyder's would-be plans for future justice league movies and the supposed batfleck solo movies?,"

Before I get ripped apart, let me get it straight; I love DC. I'm a HUGE fan of the characters. I wish with my entire heart that the snyderverse gets continued, but having snyder take a backseat. I love the idea of an older, but more violent batman. But the thought of batman sleeping with lois lane, deathstroke murdering alfred and commissioner gordon, Not having a robin or nightwing in the movie universe among other things makes me not interested in seeing those movies if Zack snyder directs them.",1623384846,nx7140

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Confused by Snyder’s planned Superman arc,"I should preface by saying I mostly like Snyder’s DC films, though I have my problems with them. But one thing that confuses me is his planned 5-film arc for Superman, which just seems convoluted from a storytelling standpoint.

From all the revealed storyboards, this is how it goes: 1) Superman begins 2) Superman dies 3) Superman is resurrected 4) Superman turns evil 5) Superman turns good again. It all feels clunky to me. For example, if he came back evil after he died and then became good, then it’d make more sense. Or if he turned evil, then died, then came back good, that would also be more streamlined. But how it is makes it feel like “the rise then fall then rise then fall then rise of Superman.”

I would obviously need to see JL2&amp;3 to fully form an opinion, but from what I’ve seen it just confuses me of what Superman’s death in BvS contributed to the 5-part story Snyder was planning. Any thoughts?",1623376465,nx4i6g

the dceu is in place where's everbody losing hope on it..it's doesn't even look like dcEU

it's need an icon..Symbol so that we not forget we're actually watching shared universe ..so maybe that we actually believe they're building something

if you think about it..Superman can appear in SS because bloodsport is there because of him..he can and should appear in both Black adam and shazam..and particularly everyone can appear in the flash

the dceu and the fans need Superman the most..and i don't think Wb is blind enough to not to see it

if cavill can't do it because he's busy or want more money or anything ..why not recast him? i don't even care anymore ..if he's not Commitment enough to the role maybe he doesn't deserve it..you have a great supermab in S&amp;L and you always could hire another actor

even if it's 1 minute of cameo in every movie it's enough to keep people watching..to keep them interested ..I've been watching dc projects since i ever start watching anything's and here iam losing intrest more every day

She's a great actress and deserves a lot better than playing second fiddle on the cringey Orville show with Seth McFarlane.

Maybe I'm just rambling here but for how good she is of an actress, how close she came to playing Wonder Woman (Imo she suits the part so much more than Gal Gadot) and how much of a fan she of these characters, I really feel she deserves a role in a DC film some day.

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: How would you rank the DCEU?,"I want to hear other people’s thoughts. Share yours in the comments. Here’s mine:

10: Suicide Squad: Dumb, boring, hard to watch, tries too hard to be edgy. Will Smith is the saving grace. 4/10

9: BOP: The action was cool but the script was trash in my opinion. Never been a big fan of the Harley Quinn character. 4.5/10

8: Josstice League: Yes it’s bad but it’s not the worst thing ever. The visuals are very awful and Steppenwolf is a terrible villain. Most of the humor was stupid. I did however enjoy the character interactions and the more hopeful lighthearted Superman. 5/10

7: Aquaman: I don’t get why everyone loves it. Jason Momoa was awesome and so were the visuals and action but the rest was actually pretty bad. It’s like it doesn’t know if it wants to be the superhero version of Lord of the Rings or Fast and Furious. It would’ve been better if it had just been one of those. 6/10

6: Wonder Woman: It’s was just ok to me. Nothing really stood out as good or as bad but it was all just ok.  7/10

5: Man of Steel: I feel similar about it to Wonder Woman but I think MOS has a killer soundtrack and Henry Cavil was born to play Superman. A little too dark and hopeless for me for a Superman movie, but for what they were going for, I like it. 7/10

4: Batman v. Superman: When I first watched it I hated it. Then I watched the directors cut and I liked it a lot better. I honestly love Affleck as Batman. Jesse Eisenberg was awful as Lex Luther though. The visuals are cool and the action is fantastic. I think the Martha scene is great and makes perfect sense. Also my favorite DCEU soundtrack. 7.2/10

3: WW84: I think it’s already very underrated. If you ignore logic for a while it’s fun and has some of my all time favorite DCEU moments. All of the actors are great. The themes about truth are fitting. My favorite visuals of the franchise (watch it in 4K if you can). I really love it and if they cut a bit from the fight scene with Cheetah at the end and explained more about how the wishes worked it would be a #2. 8/10

2: Shazam: There’s nothing really wrong with this movie. The actors are great, even the kids. Zachary Levi is incredible as the title character. Has hope and optimism that not a lot of DC films have. 9/10

1: Zack Snyder’s Justice League: This is everything I want a comic book blockbuster to be. Incredibly epic and intense throughout but has it’s quieter moments too. Very well paced for the most part. Would love to see it in IMAX. My only complaint is that the epilogue drags on and is unnecessary, since we probably won’t get sequels. 9.8/10",1623102780,nuoooo

I mean, I know that Superman doesn't kill in the comics, but I personally believe that when Superman killed General Zod, it was justified, and I think it had to be done to save the family from being killed.

DC_Cinematic,Opinion about The Flash in Zack Snyder's Justice League,"I feel in the Superman's Resurrection scene, Flash not getting in time before the motherbox touches the water makes him look really slow, and it even burn the card of him being able to reverse time, What was great about The Flash reversing time at the end is that he has to push his limits to its highest to save his friends, but The resurrection scene makes it look like it's something that he can do whenever he wants to do it, and This is actually the only thing that I like in Josstice League better, It didn't RUIN the film for me, but it is just something that bothered me about that scene.

DC_Cinematic,"[DISCUSSION] Why don't we have a ""Grayson"" HBO MAX series","I love the comic series by Tim Seeley and Tom King, and after I finished all 5 vols, I always thought it would make a banger of a TV series. For those who are unaware, Nightwing fakes his death after his identity is outed to the public, and becomes a super-spy, working for a clandestine organisation called SPYRAL, while also being a mole for Batman. Obviously we'll have to change a few things, like the entire Batman not knowing Grayson's still alive thing, but the core concept of a Spy-thriller starring the boy wonder all grown up, filled with action, intrigue, double-crossing and a heap of cool-ass gadgets? What's not to love?

It can be set in the DCEU Main (Or Snyderverse, whichever one's gonna be canon by the time this ever gets made)

So Zack said that the dead robin spoken of in BvS and ZSJL is supposed to be Dick Grayson, right? I know it's not official or anything but he said it was a headcanon of his, so let's work with that. Since we don't know the exact circumstances regarding his death, except for the Joker's involvement, we have a lot of creative leeway.

Dick and Bruce are arguing over how much good batman really does, and if he even needs a robin anymore. This leads to Dick wanting to do more than just be robin, and instead forge his own identity.

For the actual death, we can present a mashup of Jason Todd's death from *A death in the Family* and Dick Grayson's supposed death in *Forever Evil.* 

Let's say he faked his death. Not an elaborate plan or a ruse or anything, but he managed to survive a beating from the Joker by the skin of his teeth, and also escapes the warehouse before it blows up. He manages to slip away, aided by none other than Alfred, who's the only one who sympathises with Dick's plan to leave the costumed career behind. This then becomes the origin story of Agent 37, the best agent S.P.Y.R.A.L ever had. 

As to why Dick joined SPYRAL, he thought he could do more good without being tied down to Gotham and being allowed to play by his own rules for once. 

The main conflict of the show can be him unravelling a conspiracy by the very organisation he's working for, in an *Enemy of the state* or *Snowden* kind of way. I haven't really decided what the conspiracy should be yet, but there's definitely loads to pick from the comics.

The comic also had Grayson, the lovable former robin, teamed up with a no-nonsense, by-the-book senior agent called Tiger, and on-screen the buddy cop dynamic would work brilliantly. The rest of the book also has an incredible story involving recovering stolen tech and a Cold War against the other big DC spy organisation, Checkmate. I don't want to spoil any of the details because the comic is an absolute must-read. 

The main characters in the story would be:

Dick Grayson, obviously.

Agent One a.k.a Tiger. A mysterious Senior agent who loves to hate Dick, and scrutanizes everything he does.

Helena Bertinelli. After leaving the Birds of Prey, she joins SPYRAL and quickly climbs the ranks to become their deadliest assassin, and often ends up butting heads with Dick over how to handle situations. In the books she was used as an on-again-off-again love interest, so maybe the same could happen here. 

The main villain as Mr. Minos, the faceless head of SPYRAL, who has a particular fondness for Grayson that Dick exploits to unravel the conspiracy

Since Dick Grayson's a grounded character, there wouldn't be a requirement of a GoT size budget, but with a decent sized bankable from HBO, they could ensure that the production quality, cinematography, action scenes and writing are all of the highest calibre. 

Do let me know what you think of this, and if you'd like to add or change anything. I haven't really thought of the casting yet, but I think Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf) looks quite good for the part of Grayson.",1622999304,ntqf5d
DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Should the Titans Universe and The CW merge?,"Now allow to explain why I made this post and a couple of my points, DC now has three television and HBO Max universes running at the same time, which includes the CW, the Titans Universe and the DCEU.
I think that they should streamline the amount of TV universes to two, which would allow for more conectivity within the two universes and to cause less general confusion. 

My idea is to have another massive crossover event which would have the CW characters and the Titans Universe characters meet and would culminate in the two universes merging creating one big TV universe consisting of: 

• Titans
• Doom Patrol
• The Flash
• Batwoman
• Superman and Lois
• Stargirl
• Legends of Tomorrow
• Naomi
• Wonder Girl

I can understand why people would disagree with me on this but I think having a larger connected CW/HBO universe would be great and it could allow for CW shows to have bigger budgets and it could really improve the quality of the shows, but would do you guys think?",1622993446,ntoagn

So Zack Snyder was already pretty far into his cut of JL before the incident happened where he had to leave. Joss Whedon then came in and screwed it all up. Hypothetically, could he have still gone with Zack’s vision and finish it?? He was probably aware of what happened with his daughter, so it’s not like he left cuz he wanted to. That just seems crazy to me that he’d do that. So yeah my question is, would it have been possible for Joss Whedon to finish ZSJL the right way?

DC_Cinematic,Justice League Cinematic Universe - Fanmade,"**The Justice League**: The Creation of The Justice League, Which consists of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (John Stewart), Martian Manhunter and Aquaman, Teaming up together to fight DARKSEID, At The end they defeat him but This is not the last time that they will see him, The Plot of this film is very similar to the plot of Justice League: War.

**The Batman**: The plot of this film will be about Deathstroke going on a revenge journey to kill The Batman because The Batman is responsible for the death of his family, They have a big fight at the end, Similar to the Arkham Origins fight, Deathstroke escapes at the end, So, We could use him again in another film.

**Wonder Woman**: This film is really similar to Wonder Woman 1984, It will have Maxwell Lord and Cheetah as The Villains, Maxwell Lord also uses the Dream stone but it will be more fleshed out, Explaining it's origins and have clear roles and not like how they did it in WW84, Cheetah is not Cheetah until the end of the film, Where she fully transforms into her classical form, This film will be more of a political drama, talking about The lies of the government, as they want Wonder Woman to be a kind of a government symbol, Maxwell Lord escapes at the end, So does Cheetah, Because we need them in other films. 

**Martian Manhunter**: This film will be an origin story for Martian Manhunter (Obviously), Exploring where he came from like how they did with Krypton in Man Of Steel, and When he arrives to earth we will see his struggles with trying to blend in with humans, Not knowing his purpose, It will be a character study film, it will not have a villain, It's just a Pretty good superhero flick exploring Martian Manhunter's character and him working in the government, Trying to protect the world without them knowing, and at the end, When superheroes starts appearing to the world, This will grab his Attention, Which will courage him to reveal himself to the world as Martian Manhunter, Publicly Saving People, and Him becoming The Martian Manhunter.

**Aquaman**: Basically, The 2018's Aquaman, No changes at all. 

**Green Lantern Corps**: This film will not be an origin story for One Lantern, But it will tell the history of the Green Lantern and their history with the other lanterns, and Their story to the modern day, How John Stewart joined them and Many other new lanterns. 

**The Flash**: I really don't have many ideas for this one, My only ideas are Barry is investigating in his mother's murder, While fighting Captain Cold (Leonard Snart), Who is out of prison, Barry and Iris are slowly becoming together, at near the end of the second act, Barry accidentally travels back in time to his mother's murder day, and He finds out that a speedster killed his mother, after the accident while his mother is dying, He is an emotional scene with her revealing his identity to her, Telling her that he is okay and so on, then he goes to the present day, Fights Captain Cold, Locks Him in prison and saves the day, and at the end of the film Barry gets a new suit, and as a post-credit scene, Snart is in prison, and someone mysterious behind bars comes to him and say (Would like to have the opportunity to defeat The Flash?), and then it reveals that the person behinds the bars is… Maxwell Lord, The film ends 

**The Justice League vs. The Legion Of Doom**: The film is about The Justice League against The Legion Of Doom, Which Consists of (Maxwell Lord ""Leader"", Cheetah, Deathstroke, Clayface, Black Manta, Sinistro, Bizarro), The plot of this film is really similar to the cancelled George Miller's film, Justice League: Mortal, Maxwell Lord is going to use Batman's contingency plan against The Justice League, Wonder Woman vs Cheetah, Batman vs Deathstroke, Superman vs Bizarro, Aquaman vs Black Manta, John Stewart vs Sinistro, and Martian Manhunter is going to be tricked by a former agent he met in his Government times, but she will turn out to be Clayface, He has put a Venom in his drink, So Martian Manhunter is now on fire and Clayface is still fighting him, Every member of the league fights their own enemy, Except Superman and Batman, Who doesn't Know about anything until Alfred tells him about the grave of his parents, he goes there he finds the that the grave of his parents is not there, he is worried but then all of a sudden, The Wayne Manor is exploded, Batman Rushes to save Alfred, He saves him, and goes with him to The Batcave, Which is under the manor, Bruce watch the other members in the tv, He puts on his suit, goes out, only to find Deathstroke waiting for him to start the fight, Bruce is angry and he starts fighting, Superman knows about the emergency, Rushes to the save the league but out of nowhere, Bizarro reveals himself and starts fighting superman, at the of the film Batman defeats Deathstroke, and Reports the team about how to defeats the others, They win, and Finds Maxwell Lord in a Kryptonian ship (Which is one of Superman's Ships, when he came to earth), With a weird glowing box. and there is a hologram of STEPPENWOLF, They arrest him, but he is confident, at the end, There is a meeting between The Justice League about whether Batman should stay or not, but Batman quits Himself, and The film ends.

**Man Of Tomorrow**: I also don't have many ideas for this, but some of my ideas are that Brainiac is The villain, Clark and Lois are planning to get married, Some fighting happens and so on, At the end Clark and Lois get Married, and the film ends.

**New Gods**: I don't know many things about The New Gods comics, But this film's purpose is to Introduce us to Darkseid Origin and his history with Steppenwolf, and then at the end of the film, We go to the present day, Steppenwolf comes to Darkseid, Saying to him that they found the Motherboxes.

**The Justice League: No Justice Part 1/2** :- The third installment is going to be in two parts, With the title ""No Justice"", These two films are going with the original plan of ""Zack Snyder"" for The DCEU, Lois is Pregnant with Clark's child, in the first part, Steppenwolf will go against The Justice League, Batman will team up with The Justice League, at least temporary, at the last 15 minutes they kill Steppenwolf, but then a portal from Apokolips with Darkseid with an army of ships, While The Justice League are Fighting The Apokolips' Army, Darkseid teleports to the Batcave (Where Lois is staying for protection) and kills Lois with her child, Superman is devastated, Darkseid uses The Anti-Life Equation to make Superman evil, While The league is fighting, Darkseid comes in and Superman appears behind him with his eyes flaming, and now Five Years Later is the left members of the league are in the desert at night, Batman says (Let's go inside before he comes) and End Part One, Part Two is the same as Snyder Planed but Exclude The Lois child is Bruce's, Because that is the worst part of the plan, and Yes, Batman dies at the end sacrificing himself for the universe and The League continues the Mission, at the end, There is a Funeral for Batman, and The Film Ends, So Does this universe.

What do you think of this plan? Do You think it's good? Do you think it's bad? And if you have any changes, What Will it be?",1622934892,nt80w3

DC_Cinematic,[DISCUSSION] I changed my mind about Snyder's Superman (for the better I guess),"So today I had an enlightening conversation with a guy who called me a  ""dumpster fire"", a ""fucking phoney"", a ""fraud of a movie goer"", and suggested that I ""go watch planet of the chimps and spank my flabby monkey"". The reason was that I didn't like Snyder's superman. 

Bear with me, this is not some pity-party calling out, because despite all the colourful language that he used, he did make a valid point.

I had a plethora of reasons for why I didn't like Snyder's superman (which I could get into if you ask me but I don't really think they're gonna be relevant to this), but all of it boiled down to the fact that I just didn't feel inspired by the character, as he felt too much a reluctant hero and too angsty for me. To me it was like going against the very core of what made superman great, someone who always had hope and love no matter how dire the world around him was.

At this point in our conversation I had been called all sorts of names, so I didn't expect much. However, what he told me really got me thinking.

He said that this superman was hated by everyone, the media, lex, bats, but the love of one person was enough for him to die for them. He said that he's a superman for kids with bad homes, a man who would do the right thing despite feeling like it's a lost cause, and that this was the superman that made him feel better.

I stopped for a second there. 

I never actually considered what someone going through those circumstances would see, and that this superman could possibly inspire someone who had no reason to believe in a better future.

And then I stopped for another second, and realised something.

The core of Superman, which I so vehemently wanted upheld ironically, is to inspire in the darkest of times, to shine a light to those who seem like all is lost. In my attempt to discredit someone else's idea of superman, I realised that I was going against the very morals that I believed superman upheld. I felt bad. Maybe I was wrong.

Eventually we did agree upon something, that ZSJL had a closer to home supes, and that by the end of Snyder's movies (if they ever happen) all would be as I would have wanted.

There's other superman portrayals that I've connected with more, inspired me and given me hope, and if Snyder's version could do that for someone, then it seems he's done his job well. 

I don't know if Snyder's version will ever be for me, but actually understanding how he could be the one for someone else made me realise that there's no point in disliking any of the versions, be it Cavill, Cain, Reeves or Hoechlin.

Whatever qualms we may have with the portrayal, as long as they've inspired someone, anyone at all, they're all the true superman in my books now.

P.S I still think attacking someone for a diff opinion, as in name calling, is still wrong, even if you have a valid point.",1622913995,nt0rb3
DC_Cinematic,OTHER: What are your box office predictions for these upcoming DC projects ?,"Here are my predictions and i would like to know what yours are:

* The Batman - 1.1B A lot of sources are saying its very dark and after the success of the Joker i can see this hitting 1.1B
* Suicide Squad - 900M. Sure the first one wasn't that good but it still managed to gross 740M now with James Gunn if this movie is good i can see it getting 900M
* Shazam Fury Of The Gods - 700 - 800M. The First Shazam was amazing and managed to gross 366M while competing with Captain marvel and Endgame.
* Black Adam - 900M - 1B. WB will market the hell out of this since the rock is the main star also this movie is kinda like a justice league film since it has a lot big superheroes like Dr.Fate and Hawkman.
* Aquaman - 1B. The first one grossed 1.1B and it wont drop by too much.

 Please tell me your predictions.",1622913949,nt0qr6
DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Do you think the filmmakers will consider the Snyder Cut canon going forward?,"We’ve had Patty Jenkins, James Wan, and now Andy Muschietti all saying they consider the Snyder Cut the precursor to all of their films. I’d be curious to see what Shazam 2 considers canon as well as the Suicide Squad and Black Adam. 

I’d like to think that the Rock and Dany Garcia would be pushing for Cavill to return as Superman and cementing MoS and the Snyder Cut as canon, but we’ll have to wait and see. We can always hope that Cavill’s visit to the US is DC related, at least somewhat. I’d love for Zack and the Rock to revive the plan to establish the Injustice League/Legion of Doom led by Luthor and Black Adam with the JL being led by Batman and Superman. 

So what do you guys think, will DC directors consider the Snyder Cut canon going forward?",1622909463,nsz4y3

DC_Cinematic,DCC Multiverse,"I’d love to see the multiverse streamlined, combining Earths rather than each old live-action series being it’s own.

Easiest way to do this imo is by starting with our Supermen:

#1. Kirk Alyn ‘48
This incorporates all other DC serials (Adventures of Captain Marvel, Spy Smasher, Batman, Hop Harrigan, The Vigilante, Superman, Congo Bill, Batman and Robin, Atom Man vs Superman, The Miraculous Blackhawk: Freedom’s Champion)

#2. George Reeves ‘51
Combine with Adam West’s Batman ‘66, Lynda Carter’s Wonder Woman ‘75, and Jackson Bostwick’s Captain Marvel/Shazam! ‘74 (Include ‘79s Legends of the Superheroes’ Green Lantern, Black Canary, Hawkman, Flash, and Huntress.)

#3. Christopher Reeve(/Brandon Routh) ‘78
Melded with Michael Keaton’s Batman ‘89, Supergirl ‘84, Swamp Thing ‘82. Could also duplicate WW ‘75 and LotS ‘79 casts onto this Earth, with the exception of Flash who’d be from the ‘90 series.

#4. Dean Cain ‘93
Batman ‘95/‘97, Steel ‘97, duplicate ‘90s Flash

#5. Tom Welling ‘01
Birds of Prey ‘02, Catwoman ‘04

#6. Henry Cavill ‘13
DCEU

#7. Tyler Hoechlin ‘21
Arrowverse

(Now we switch to Batmen for the remaining worlds)

#8. Dark Knight trilogy ‘05
Batman is either the only hero on this Earth, or we use a Brandon Routh duplicate and Green Lantern ‘11 (+ the Wonder Woman ‘11 pilot.)

#9. Titans ‘18
Possibly shared with Doom Patrol

#10. The Batman ‘22

I’d love to see comic series set on these 10 Earths, or small cameos next time a Flash travels the multiverse onscreen!

Let me know any shows/movies I’ve missed and where they’d fit best, and how you’d number the Earths. (For example the serials’d be Earth 2, set around WWII.)

Which iterations are your favorites you’d like to see return/meet each other?

Notes: ^David ^Wilson ^was ^Superman ^in ^a ^1975 ^musical, ^awfully ^close ^to ^Reeve’s ^so ^maybe ^that ^Earth ^was ^destroyed... ^There’s ^also ^a ^Superboy ^series ^starring ^John ^Newton ^then ^Gerard ^Christopher, ^which ^could ^be ^retconned ^as ^the ^backstory ^of ^Cain ^and/or ^Reeve. ^Captain ^Marvel ^on ^Reeve’s ^Earth ^would ^be ^Garret ^Craig ^of ^LotS ^‘79s ^instead ^of ^Bostwick.

DC_Cinematic,"Opinion: I, A Die Hard BvS Hater Just Watched Zack Snyder's Justice League For The First Time, Here's My Review","Just off the bat, I was fine with Man of Steel (Pa Kent really stops me from really loving it) but I hated BvS, I hated the way they treated Clark Kent/Superman, the way they portrayed Batman/Bruce Wayne and most of all I hated the Martha scene, Lex and Doomsday.

So I wasnt really bothered by the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut Movement, I wouldn't care either way if it was released or not and when it was released I decided to wait a couple of weeks for the hype to die down and now it has, tonight I sat down and watched The Snyder Cut for the first time and guess what?

I FRIGGIN LOVED IT.

I loved the way they handled Bruce Wayne/Batman in this movie, it has defiantly moved Affleck into my top three theatrical Batmen behind Bale and Conroy. Ben just seemed to really enjoy the role more in this film than he did in BvS and his Zen like quality reminds me of the Grant Morrison Batman.

I also loved Flash and Cyborg and now I understand why Fisher was so pissed off with the theatrical cut, he really is the heart and soul of the movie and has overtaken Doom Patrol Cyborg as my all time favourite Cyborg (which is a hard thing for me to admit cause I love Doom Patrol) and the scene with Flash running backwards in time was breath taking.

The action scenes were great as well especially the Lord of the Rings style battles.

I do have a couple of issues with pacing, too many slow motion musical numbers around Aquaman, you could have easily cut the Iris West scene and it wouldnt have made a difference, nic picks like that.

And I do have issues  with the way Superman was handled in this movie, in my own personal opinion Snyder has really struggled with what direction to take the character post MoS and I dont think his death and resurrection character arc really had an impact.

And I wished Diana and Arthur had more to do.

But still I liked this cut, I gave the original Justice League (or as its known here as Josstice League) two stars out of five, but I will give the Snyder Cut three and a half stars out of five which means its tied with  Watchmen as my favourite Snyder film.",1622859536,nslfuo
DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: Comic book fans who also watch these movies, explain to me why an alien like Superman can easily beat a God like Steppenwolf?","I've always been under the impression that godhood in most mediums (certainly comics) means unprecedented strength and power over other beings in the same universe/dominion. We see that in the Marvel Universe with Thor for example- he was able to oneshot the alien Thanos at the end of Infinity War.

DC have their own gods, yet Superman is consistently shown to be as strong if not stronger than them. Growing up, I remember him fighting and beating Darkseid in the cartoons, and now in the DCEU, Zack had him easily one-up Steppenwolf. In the beginning of the film, Steps even tells Desaad that he's glad the Kryptonian isn't here to protect the planet.

Why is that? Has DC ever given an explanation for their gods being underpowered?",1622852174,nsjaml

DC_Cinematic,Snyderverse comics!,"Last night, I made a post about if the Snyderverse was restored what movies would you like to see? I got a bunch of comments saying about the movies they want to see, most of them were Batfleck, Man of Steel 2, Deathstroke, JL 2 and JL 3, Etc.

Since at the moment, there seems to be no hope for the Snyderverse... to quote Thanos: ""Fine, I'll do it myself.""

Here are the list of stories I plan to adapt into comics.

  

Pre-BvS Batman, telling of his rise to a hopeful batman like the one we see in the Batman Tas seasons 1-3. But he loses it all thanks to Joker and his darkness. This era ends with the Black Zero event. I was thinking of releasing the first half of the story where Batman is in one of the brightest moments of his life and after ZSJL3 release the other half that shows his fall a la Metal Gear Solid V.

&amp;#x200B;

David Ayer’s Suicide Squad: While I can't get it to be 100% like how it would have been (nobody but Ayer can do that.) This will be my attempt to replicate what would have been his suicide squad. Although I am thinking of making a few changes. Mostly just the Joker.

  

Flash: This movie has been changed several times and while I am excited to see the movie coming out next year, I want to create my own version since the plans for the justice league sequels mention a Len Snart. Supposedly Cyborg was in this movie too.

&amp;#x200B;

Man of Tomorrow: I plan to have Henry Cavill's Superman fight against braniac

&amp;#x200B;

Cyborg: I'll have to figure this out. He has his origin placed out so I don't need to worry about that... but I still have to learn about him.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben Affleck’s Batman: Bats goes up against Deathstroke

&amp;#x200B;

Deathstroke: I was thinking maybe a prequel to Ben Affleck's Batman to explain why Deathstroke wants Batman dead... or maybe a sequel to Ben Affleck's Batman? I'll have to plan this further.

&amp;#x200B;

The Atom: This character is the one I know nothing about, I will have to read comics about Ryan Choi so I can know who he is and what he's like.

&amp;#x200B;

Superman/Batman (If possible): I feel like the heads of the DCEU are missing from the DCEU so I want to make a comic that has them working together to show how their friendship has progressed and to contrast the hate Bats had for Supes.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash/Cyborg: Flash and Cyborg seemed to have a budding friendship in the background of ZSJL and he was originally planned to be in the flash movie. So I'll have to figure this one out.

&amp;#x200B;

Martian Manhunter: I barely know this guy, I'll have to learn about him.

&amp;#x200B;

Zack Snyder’s Justice League 2: So begins the end. A few changes will have to be made like no Bruce and Lois relationship, but the story has already been mapped out. I want superman to appear before this so when he succumbs the anti-life equation, it's all the more devastating to see the best hero of the DCEU, the one that everyone looks up to... fall and become the most deadly force on the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

Green Lantern: Get to know John Steward and the Green Lantern Corp. This is admittedly inspired by Captain Marvel being released after Infinity War,

&amp;#x200B;

New Gods: Learn Darkseid's and the New God's story. Get to know the pantheon and feel the despair they bring to worlds.

&amp;#x200B;

Zack Snyder’s Justice League 3: It all ends here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a Batman fan all my life. I know him like the back of my hand. However I barely know the rest of the DC universe. I know Superman a bit but not much compared to Bats.

DC_Cinematic,Small Snyderverse Movie Fix: Show Bruce Wayne's scars,"I'm not sure if this has been posted here, or addressed by Snyder himself, but seeing a scarless, flawless Affleck really snaps me out of the immersion of the movie for some reason. 

We see Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne shirtless more than a couple times in the whole Snyderverse, and his skin is flawless (apart from a few bruises shown in the Whedon version of JLA). But by the time he's introduced, he's been Batman for DECADES. He should be scarred up, very much like the Alex Ross painting of Bruce: https://i.imgur.com/jFQLlHU.jpg. I mean, in BvS alone, h's stabbed in the shoulder during the warehouse scene. 

I think showing how scarred up he is, especially in front of the other League members, would really put in to perspective how vulnerable he is compared to the others. It would also show that he's been doing this crime-fighting, superhero thing for so long, and kind of cement himself as the veteran of the group.

DC_Cinematic,"OTHER: Some common ""plot-holes"" from the Dark Knight Trilogy I'd like to resolve.","Batman Begins: 

Q: ""Why did Ra's Al Ghul put a decoy (Ken Watanabe) in his League of Shadows headquarters?"" 

Answer: We don't have specific background details of the character Ken plays. But we do know that he is some kind of a monk (apparel and shaved head), which means he could've been the spiritual advisor and the right hand man of Ra's. Perhaps Ra's thought that new members would be keen to listening to a head monk type character rather than a bearded white guy. 

Q: ""Why didn't Gotham citizens get poisoned by the sedative if Crane has been pouring it into the water supply for weeks?""

Answer: They literally explain it in the film. The forensic investigator says ""must be a compound that has to be absorbed through people's lungs"". Also the microwave emmiter focuses the blast on specific liquids and hence why not all the liquids in the city turned into gas. 

The Dark Knight:

Q: ""How did Joker know certain things would take place right at the exact moment?""

Answer: Maybe he didn't, maybe he did. Probability is a statistical element that looks to solve certain events. Maybe Joker was familiar with it and did his math. Maybe he left it all to chance. But certainly he took his chances when the plan involved bombings and kidnapping. 

The Dark Knight Rises:

Q: ""How did Batman fix his back so quickly?""

Answer: although not stated clearly, the film takes place over the span of 6 months (approx). Some physical therapies can take 3-4 months, given the circumstances. Any severe injuries can take longer to heal. Maybe Bruce was in pain and on painkillers the entire third act. But certainly he had enough time to heal slightly. 

Q: ""Why did Bane and Talia take so long to blow up the city?"". 

Answer: Like they said it themselves, they wanted Bruce to see his own city tear itself to pieces. Bane wanted society to crumble on itself and wanted to give Bruce the first row seat to it. 

Q: ""How did Bruce get back to Gotham without any help so fast?"". 

Answer: Bruce travelled around the world and lived among criminals in his mid twenties. He learnt a skill or two about ilegally crossing borders and walking on ice, which people failed to do in order to get in or out of Gotham.

DC_Cinematic,"This may be an unpopular opinion here. Zack Snyder's movies are good only because DC has nothing better to offer, they still have their own flaws which can't be overlooked.","Snyder really understands the characters and brings some amount of originality to them as well and I love that apart from the cinematography that he does. 

However, I feel like these days whatever he says, fanboys just go after it. Okay, the justice league cut was amazing, far far better than TC. But it ain't enough. Just Snyder's vision ain't enough. Not is having him direct or oversee every other DC movie. So stop asking for it! 

I don't like the thought that he crams up so much in a single movie. Many times it just seems like fan service. For instance, BvS was going good and then he had to shove in Doomsday and also death of superman in it. Man, it was good. But it was just too much to take in. Superman was just established as a hero one movie back, and now he's dead.

And in the next one whoa he's alive again, coz there was no other choice, you killed him too soon. And there's Darkseid. Again, it looked fantastic but too rushed. Too much put together in one go. Like trying to do what Marvel did in one 4 hour movie. Then forcefully bringing in Man hunter, what was the point?? He didn't have anything to add on to the story. But people be like, whoa man hunter is there.. Or green lanterns.. It doesn't even add up tbh. 

Disappointed that WB execs are not too creative either.

I don't know if anyone else agrees, but overusing characters would just limit it to Snyder's vision. It reduces room for other movies with other directors where a significant character build up could have happened without putting it all in one go.

DC_Cinematic,FAN-MADE: DC Movie Music Edits,"After spending the weekend watching nothing but Tim Burton, I was encouraged to switch some music up. I took for different DC movies and re-scored them with music by some of DC's most prolific composers.   


[The first edit ""*If Hans Zimmer Scored Richard Donner's Superman*"".  I used some of my favorite tracks from Man of Steel to rescore the scene where Superman turns back time to save Lois.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv30bgdOi2Y&amp;t=74s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentralRatCatcherCentral)  


  


[The second edit is ""*If Junkie XL Scored Tim Burton's Batman*"". I took one of the more campy and over the top action scenes from the film rescored it with Tom's Batman theme from ZSJL.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uq-ZDZhUkE&amp;t=4s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentralRatCatcherCentral)  


  


[The third edit is ""*If John Williams Scored Man of Steel*"". Instead of going the obvious route and inserting the iconic march into scenes where Superman is being heroic, I rescored the final fight between Kal-El and Zod. It also includes Zod's death as well. The whole sequence is scored with John Williams' scores from Revenge of the Sith and The Force Awakens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSJD7Krscp4&amp;t=94s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentralRatCatcherCentral)  


  
[And the fourth and final edit is ""*If Danny Elfman Scored Zack Snyder's Justice League*"". This one was hard to pick a scene. I didn't want to do any action scenes, but I wanted to do a more emotional scene. I almost picked Clark's reunion with Martha and the death of Silas Stone, but I opted to go with Barry saving Iris. I wanted to build up the intensity of the truck crash, but then add a sense of playfulness and romance when Barry saves Iris. I used his music from The Wolfman, Spider-Man 2, and Frankenweenie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy6_sFDKMjw&amp;t=98s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentralRatCatcherCentral)  


  
As I mentioned with other edits, I don't make them because I think the original scores are bad. I like making them to see how much a scene can change with different music. It's for fun because I can't draw and don't know how to make cool TikTok edits, so this is all I can make in my spear time.  


I'm also open to any suggestions for edits. Well, have fun!",1622654160,nqqy7s
DC_Cinematic,THOUGHTS: Having your Cake and Eating it too: or why so many people are sour on Man of Steel,"Spoiler for MoS and BvS

I often see this topic broached every few years, and is getting somewhat of a revival recently, but I don't see a lot of people talking about Man of Steel in terms of its narrative framing. What I mean by that is how the film wants you to see certain things, as bad or good or neutral. When Pa Kent tells Clark that it would have been better to let those kids die, the narrative wants to tell you that this is the right call, further validated by his avoidable death.

That this is his characterization would be fine if it wasn't simultaneously relying on the image people of Superman in pop culture to sanitize the same character. The Clark in Man of Steel is callous to say the least. Realistically speaking, people in Superman's world would not like him. Yet, aside from making the military grumpy, there is very little backlash to Superman and the lesson his parents taught him are framed as being right in the end. There he stands, making out with Lois on top of what used to be Metropolis.

The differences between this and Avengers battle of New York is there are scenes in New York that show a conscious effort to minimize civilian deaths and evacuate. This goes at least part of the way to explain why people are more receptive to the Avengers. There is no effort in Man of Steel to show Superman actually caring about the city he's destroying. No effort to move the fight elsewhere with no civilians or any regard for their lives. And yet, the narrative wants you believe that these people are traditional heroes as you, the public, knows them. This is especially obvious when you look at BvS. In the narrative, Bruce hates Superman's guts, talked to him for five minutes and then he died but their 'relationship' reads as one of at least a few years. The film assumes you know they're friends and so the narrative requires them to be friends, even if it doesn't make sense.

Feel free to disagree. FYI; I don't like the Reeves Superman at all, but Superman is one of my favorite superheroes. Unpopular opinion: Man of Steel, with absolutely nothing else changed, would be a lot better if it was a gritty anime.",1622644291,nqn4l9

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: What if Superman had killed Batman in BVS?,"Title says it all. I thought this would be fun to discuss this hypothetical “what if” scenario. 

If Superman had managed to get the upper hand on Batman during their fight and had killed Bruce in self defense, how do you think events would’ve played differently? 

Would Clark be successful in rescuing Martha? 

How would the Doomsday fight play out differently if Bruce was out of the picture? 

Would Clark still sacrifice himself like he did and would Superman still earn the public’s respect?

What would Batman’s legacy be if he didn’t survive that fight? Would Clark, Alfred,  or Diana try to resurrect him?

DC_Cinematic,Anyone willing to help how to start with DC?,"I don't really know if I should be posting this here. I grew up not really watching or giving any chance for American superhero movies or comics (anime is/was bigger here in the Philippines so I grew up with those). I recently watched Man of Steel first and the MCU movies for the first time and I just finished it last month. I gotta say, I think the superhero genre is growing on to me. 

Now I want to experience the DC side of things but I do not know where to start. I've done a bit of research and I got more confused. Apparently DC and Marvel always does reboots? (Correct me of I'm wrong) and I don't know where to start. Unlike in anime like One Piece or Naruto where it's a long continuous story. What's considered canon in American comics? And if it's possible I would like to start with Batman because upon reading his wiki description, he has some similarities with my fave Marvel hero Iron Man. But again, where should I start? Should I start with the games? The cartoons or movies?

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Are you okay with a black Clark Kent?,"I've seen a lot of negativity surrounding this decision, and while I am completely supportive of this decision - I'd like to see what this subreddit thinks. I know a lot of you have said you want it to be Calvin Ellis or Val Zod, but these two characters barely have any story to adapt. They don't have much, if any side characters and they've never really had a whole story of their own. Maybe a loosely explained origin, but not a lore or anything big like Clark has had. They're not nearly as developed as Miles was before his movie adaptation, so I can see why they didn't choose them. Anyways, if your opinion is a little more complex or in-depth than these options, comment it down here.

DC_Cinematic,"APPRECIATION: Cruella movie with ""DC scent""","Many will have noticed it (if they have seen the movie) and it is that the recent Cruella de Vil movie has some elements with which from a certain point of view they could be compared to DC products

The protagonist's story looks like a ""black level"" / elseworld version of Harley Quinn, plus it has a touch of the 2019 Joker movie.

Especially about Joker, the song Smile by Jimmy During that was used in the promotion of that movie, is heard at a key moment from Cruella. Also included are the songs ""Come Together"" that was used in the promotional campaign and is the ending credits song of Justice League (2017) although in another version. And another song that is heard almost at the end of the film is Sympathy For The Devil by The Rolling Stones, this song is heard almost at the beginning of the 2016 Suicide Squad movie, in the scene in which Amanda Waller makes the appearance of her .

They are probably just coincidences, but without a doubt it is something very curious.

Even Batman and Superman in his movies are arguably about the common good. I know there’s a stupid video out there that says otherwise. But Snyder isn’t saying Superman is above everyone else.

Looking at some of the concept, [one of them is for a Joker gang of sorts.](https://static2.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Batman-89-Concept-Art-3.jpeg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=737&amp;h=335&amp;dpr=1.5) I like to think this gang is a reimagined version of the Jokerz.  

For the uninitiated, the Jokerz are a street gang in the year 2039. They, in part, are the reason why Terry McGinnis inherits the Batman mantle from Bruce Wayne. While the art doesn't say they're called Jokerz, I wouldn't be surprised if they were a version of the gang.  

Combine this concept art with Michael Keaton reprising his role as Bruce Wayne in The Flash. I think it completely goes without saying that Keaton is playing an older Bruce Wayne, considering Keaton himself will be turning 70 this year. Now, what exactly Keaton's role in the film is unknown, but I doubt it's either for a cameo or even a one-off appearance. Andy Muschietti stated that Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne has a ""Substantial emotional impact in the film due to his relationship with Barry Allen. In part to both of their mothers being murdered."" I take it Keaton's Bruce Wayne will serve as an Obi-Wan Kenobi like figure for Barry when he finds himself lost in time. I remember hearing rumors that Keaton's appearance could set up Batgirl, but I don't think it will.   

Between a new Joker inspired street gang and Michael Keaton being roughly the right age, I think this new comic series and The Flash could set up a Batman Beyond story. Whether it's for a movie or a series is beyond me, no pun intended. Regardless, expect Keaton to stick around for quite some time.",1622335574,no02dx

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Were people surprised that Superman could use freeze breath in ZSJL?,"It was the only power Snyder's Superman had never displayed in terms of what is recognized as mainstream Superman powers. He had flight, super speed, super strength, nigh invulnerability, heat vision, X-Ray vision, and superhearing, but not freeze breath or super breath. 

It seemed like Snyder omitted it cause he didn't like it as a superpower. 
It popped up in Josstice League, but it was obviously a reshoot due to Henry 's messed up face. But apparently, the idea of Superman getting freeze breath after his resurrection was Snyder's idea first as proven in ZSJL.

I was surprised to see it to be honest. But happy as well since I missed it as a signature superpower. But it also was a good way to display that  post-resurrection Superman was indeed more powerful than before he died.",1622290202,nnm5w9

The plot was predictable, yes, and there were a lot of cliches, but it was still equally enjoyable as the first one for me (and this one benefits from not having a dogshit final act that completely undermine's Diana's development). I think Maxwell Lord was a fantastic villain who gets caught up in proving to himself and his son that he's not a ""loser-man."" Cheetah, however, was kinda meh.

Trust me, I get the whole “we want another villain” talk, and Phillips even agrees, he tried to get a black label type thing going, WB didn’t bite. I think the fact that he’s writing proves that he indeed does have more of that story to tell, so I am 1000% for it.",1622159748,nml0xe
DC_Cinematic,Who is the Strongest titan,"I just saw this post about the strongest titan and i want to bring it back and add some things.

1. Robin, easily one of my favourite superheroes from marvel and dc, he defeated all of the titans as an apprentice and he was trained by batman, easily the strongest dick grayson/Robin in existence, he can pick up throw cinderblock like its nothing.

2. Beastboy, can turn into any animal and demons but he has to be in the demon realm for that, same goes for aliens (which is kinda stupid, he should be able to turn into them willingly everywhere after he memorises the genetic code and turned into them once, but thats my opinion) which means he can turn into a kryptonion but this is useless as he has to be on krypton for that and his kryptonian powers wouldn't work their, but nevertheless he can turn into a tamaranian, trigon, one of the most powerful beings in the dc universe and a lot more powerful demons and aliens. Also he got into cyborgs body once, he can turn Into any germ bigger the size of a few atoms, he can just turn into a germ, enter superman's or trigon blood circulation and turn into a whale so they'd explode. Anyone would die from this this is obviously super overpowered.

3. Cyborg, superhuman strength, superhuman jumpforce, superhuman intelligence, condensed soundwaves canons which is totally overpowered as it should make anyone's head explode but of course they wouldn't show this in teen titans. 

4. Starfire, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, UV light absorption and the ability to shoot star bolts and lasereyes. Pretty self explainable.

5. Raven. Raven is without a doubt one of the most powerful characters in dc. She can do anything but they held her back in the show because she could just murder everyone. She can warp reality, dimension travel, time travel, time manipulation, make universes explode and create practically anything

Without a doubt Raven is the most powerful, but taking Raven out of the picture because its not fair to count her in, I'd say beastboy is the strongest titan as he can turn into a germ and make others explode. What are your thoughts on this? Also gotta give credit to robin, he beat all the titans once",1622147535,nmgvym

From the Article about Superman:

Speaking of things that are wild, you are now participating in the legacy of one of the most powerful superhero characters. What can you say about Superman and what the journey has been like for you thus far?

Nothing I can say would be helpful here. Absolutely nothing. Nothing I can say will do anything to improve how this film is ultimately received. I got a big thing: I want people to have their own experience with the art, and I don’t want to step on it. I don’t want them to hear me. I don’t want them to see me. As much as possible, I really don’t want them to see me. I want them to see what we ultimately produce. And so what I’m trying to do is ... I’m not even being coy here.

We live in an era where people — because you have social media and can share so much — the instinct when you’re creating is to let fans in on the process, to let them see where you’re going. And I might could do that after. That might be an aftermath thing I would do, but I do worry about doing injustice to the art.

I just worry that you are, however unintentionally, seeding ideas in people’s head. Now, look, there’s a point where you have trailers and things where I’m going to have to talk about it, but if it were up to me, I wouldn’t say anything ever until it’d been out and seen and consumed and all of that. I don’t want to get in the way. I want Superman to have his chance.",1622087820,nlz0dc

DC_Cinematic,[DISCUSSION] Super frustrated with WB and conflicted about the franchise's future.,"First let me start by saying that I am a huge Zack Snyder fan. I understand he can be polarizing, some may not like his style, but I am of the opinion that when left alone, he can make some beautiful, cerebral, epic movies. They just so happen to wind up being 3-4 hours long. This is not a problem to me. 

Look at the massive improvement to Watchmen in the director's cut, the massive improvement to BvS in the Ultimate Edition, and obviously the triumph that is ZSJL. The dude knows how to make long character driven epics. 

Unfortunately WB just loves to force a round peg into a square hole (i.e. expecting snyder to make a 2hr safe crowd pleaser, or expecting Joss Whedon to mesh perfectly with a Snyder style film and story.) Of course this behavior has led to disaster and blow after blow to Snyder's reputation. They finally let him breathe, the results were hugely successful and... they want nothing to do with him. What the fuck?

I'm honestly frustrated and heartbroken that we will likely never see ZSJL part 2. After watching ZSJL I would watch a 4 hour sequel in a heartbeat. I'm pissed off that the experimental risky counterweight to your average comic book movie has been roundly rejected by the studio due to their own poor choices. 

That brings me to The Batman and the Superman reboot. Now I am sure that Pattinson will be a good Batman, and we are most likely in for a very good time when the film hits theaters. Unfortunately my perspective is tainted and I keep thinking of what might have been when I think about the movie. Every time it reminds me that we're moving on. Same thing with the Superman reboot. Having a black Superman will be cool too, but I just saw Henry Cavill in one of the coolest sequences in a comic book film (coming in and wrecking Steppenwolf's shit) and I want more!

Maybe the Flash movie will set up a multiverse and we can have both? Seems unlikely.

TL;DR WB fucked up big time and passed the buck, spoiling the future of the movies I most want to see. My frustration with the situation is unfortunately keeping me from being as excited as I would be about promising new films. 😒",1621989326,nl46sl

I think because Batman is too important for them and maybe there was tensions behind the scene in Thebatman and they made the deal with him in order to please him and get his involvement with WB cause the Batman franchise is too important to mess up. WB would do everything to not mess up this trilogy. Pattinson is in a very big power position right now with his Batman cause of WBs weak position. The DCEU failed with Battfleck and Henrys Superman. WB can not afford any drama so they made this deal.,1621977501,nl0atu

DC_Cinematic,THOUGHTS: (spoilers obv) I'm sorry but the final confrontation between Diana and Max made no sense,"she knocks the camera aside so he steps into the a light which is implied to be the TV signal (which for some reason is this beam of light going from the ground to the ceiling and totally unprotected and has no reason to be there and looks more like the transporter on Star Trek than a TV signal), but he walks into the signal and this allows for him to continue broadcasting??? walking into the light of the TV signal allows for him to continue broadcasting?????? feel like it should just give him cancer or something instead.

But then they take it further and Diana **talks** to the audience through Max by lassoing him with the Lasso of Truth, which shows him the truth and also somehow has the power to broadcast her words over the signal by overriding Max's thoughts?

Yea, I get that her dialogue is mostly meant for us and not Max's audience but that still leaves the implication that she can broadcast the truth over the signal just by lassoing Max while he's being inexplicably broadcasted over the signal???

Also, somehow other people renouncing their wishes causes Max to finally see the truth? that was badly explained. Sure, it can be said that Diana needed enough of the audience to renounce their wish so that what Max took them for in exchange for their wish had to be returned, which meant his health declined but apparently health decline == ability to see the truth from the Lasso??

My god the amount of Hand Wave in this movie and this scene was just.....


I mean, I guess I should not expect much from a movie where a WWI pilot somehow knows how to fly a plane from 1984.

Superman, Batman and WW are no brainers. Flash and Aquaman are other 2 that are famous. Round the team up with Green Arrow, or some other down the earth character and you have an amazing start to your JL team.


First movie can be in media res, or origins of the watchtower. Why explain anything into details? The general audiences know the shtick. Give a good strong villain and roll with it.

The JL animated show introduced JL in just 20 minutes and made it all official in 60 minutes with alien invasion as a backdrop to explain why certain characters appeared.

So, 1st movie could be invasion of White Martians and introduction of MManhunter and Diana. The team would already be consisting of Flash Batman and Superman.

After that first movie you have the big 5.


2nd mkvie should be atlanthean invasion and introduction of Aquaman.

And 3rd movie could be another space enemy that escaped jurisdiction of GL corps and you introduce GL with that.

Only after those 3 movies do you spin off.

Make a GL space buddy cop movie with Hal and Jon.

Make an Superman movie about rise of Lex Luthor.

Make Batman movie about how his enemies started busting out of Arkham after he barely cleaned up the city. The villains in wuestion should be ones without strong narative ties to Batman. So im thinking Penguin, Clay face and such. Save Joker, Bane, Two face for the future development.

Start building up Braniac as the first big bad, then go for Zod, then build up Steppenwolf and Darkseid as the Thanos level threat of not bigger.

You could make 10 JL movies, 5 Batman movies, 3 Superman movies (3rd being Doomsday and death of superman) etc etc. 

Just get one guy in control and do what Feige and Marvel does (logistically)",1621958515,nkt7fe
DC_Cinematic,Rumour: Roberts agent was calling around and searching for other work,"Grace  claims that  Roberts agent was calling around and searching for other  work because of the tension between Robert and Matt last year during  production of TheBatman.

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Will films continue to be interconnected?,"There are lots of opportunities for the DCEU to still be a DCEU, even without Cavill and Affleck, but what are the odds WB goes through with any of it? Unlikely, but here are some ideas. 

Shazam: Fury of the Gods will feature many beings from Greek mythology, which would give it a connection to the Wonder Woman films. They could have any of those characters re-appear in a Wonder Woman movie.

Blue Beetle and Peacemaker are both originally properties owned by Charlton Comics, and both the Peacemaker series and Blue Beetle movie could cross over. The Question is also from Charlton Comics, a mantle Renee Montoya from the Birds of Prey film could take on. We could have a full Charlton team up movie if they'd introduce Captain Atom.

The Suicide Squad will introduce King Shark, an aquatic villain who could re-appear in an Aquaman film, even as a brief cameo. 

Black Adam will introduce the JSA, which could lead to a JSA spin-off. Hourman is getting his own movie. Hourman could make a cameo or at least be mentioned in Black Adam ahead of his own film and possibly even a role in a JSA movie.

Doctor Fate will also appear in Black Adam, because he is a sorceror he could appear in Zatanna. Doctor Fate could be everywhere in the DCEU if they wanted him to be.

Plastic Man could spin-off into an Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters movie. 

If Batgirl is in the DCEU they could bring back the Birds of Prey for a cameo, maybe even renew interest in a sequel.",1621812584,njk6qg

DC_Cinematic,[DISCUSSION] How Paul Dano's Riddler Could Work Well as an Original Interpretation (and Why He Might Not),"Although the Riddler's appearance in *The Batman* is being received positively, I'm still very split on it, like many other people. This isn't because I need him to be 100% comic-accurate, but because I feel that he should still be...well...the Riddler. Therefore, I think I know what could be done with him to allow Matt Reeves to invent an all-new take on the Riddler while still making it so the character is still faithful enough to the source material.

First of all, if you're not going to make him *look* a ton like the Riddler, you can at least capture the *spirit* of the Riddler. Joaquin Pheonix's Joker is a perfect example of this, as he captures the comical essence of the Joker better than Heath Ledger's, in my opinion, despite not even sharing the character's classic color scheme. So, let's say that this creepy disguise of his is what he uses to threaten Gotham and make them understand that he means business. If you remember what happens in *Iron Man 3*, the Mandarin's played out as this brilliant, diabolical terrorist leader...until Tony Stark busts into his mansion, and he turns out to just be a sleazy pervert. I understand that many fans hated that twist (I did when I saw it!) but if *The Batman* does something a little like that, with Riddler turning out to be more of a skittish smartass when he's seen *without* his disguise (while making sure he's still obsessive-compulsive and a legitimate threat, of course), that would be a pleasant twist for making him true to the character at heart. It'd make sense why he'd use such a terrifying, Zodiac Killer-esque masquerade to conceal his true identity, too. After all, how seriously would Gotham take him if he sported a goofy bright green suit and bowler hat?

In all honesty, I have zero complaints about *The Batman* aside from Riddler. I think it looks like a uniquely grim, stylistic murder mystery, as well as a great companion piece for *Joker*. Even though I'm worried about this version of Riddler playing an integral role in the film, I've been trying to hold a more ""this could definitely work somehow"" kind of mindset lately. I've also become more experimental when it comes to crafting original character interpretations after seeing *Joker*, so I'm hopeful that they'll find a way to maintain a balance between comic accuracy and creativity.

So Suicide Squad takes place roughly 9months after BvS, but that means Justice League would have to take place after those 9 months?

The Motherboxes awaken shortly after Superman's death in both versions of JL, so for Suicide Squad to take place roughly 9 months after his death it would also mean that the Motherboxes/Steppenwolf graciously waited until those events were over? 

Unless both films take place somewhat at the same time concurrently, with SS ending just before Superman's resurrection?

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: How I would have done Superman's arc differently,"I just want to get this out of the way and say that I'm not a Snyder hater. I definitely don't agree with a lot of his decisions, but he seems like a nice guy, and there are still a lot of things I do like in his movies. That being said, I've always felt disconnected from his interpretations of these characters, so I started to wonder how I would have done it differently.


For starters, I don't think Superman has a clear arc in MoS. I suppose you could say his arc is how he goes from being conflicted about himself to being self-assured, but for what is already a restrained performance, it's hard to communicate that an internal change has actually happened. I believe you can do a lot more with the character, and I think the movie believes it has. 


Superman's actions are mostly stagnant throughout the movie. In his childhood, he's using his powers to save people. In his adulthood, he's using his powers to save people, and as Superman, he's using his powers to save people. If you're going to make the conflict whether or not he should be saving people, I think that conflict should be clear in his actions. He does go against that once when he lets Jonathan die, but I think in order to make that arc more impactful, they could have really delved into it.


Maybe Clark saves people as a kid, but he vows to abide by Jonathan's dying wish and regresses as a character. Maybe as an adult, he hasn't used his powers in public since Jonathan's death. At the oil rig, instead of making some epic display of super strength, he could have restrained himself and tried to get everyone out with his mortal abilities, but that restraint ends up causing someone to get left behind.


All of these opportunities where Clark could have saved people start to take a toll on him, and he can't live with that burden anymore. Then, Zod delivers his warning, and it's the straw that breaks the camel's back. Clark dawns the cape and vows to protect the Earth, whether that be because it's his duty or because he feels he owes it to them after all the times he didn't. Now, when he steps out of the fortress, it really signifies a change in character and it isn't just a change in attire. From here on out, his actions will be different from who he was.",1621632561,ni3dsg

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Is anyone disappointed in Superman's arc in Snyder's plans for JL2 and 3?,"Now before you downvote me and call me a hater, I'd like to preface with the fact that I love Man of Steel. I liked a lot of the ultimate cut of BvS,  and I really liked the Snyder Cut. I just think based on the storyboards and what Snyder has said in interviews, the arc in his JL sequels for Superman would be very lazy and a complete redo of his arc in the first 3 movies. Also, I know many things in his plan changed from when the storyboards were written, but his comments on superman's arc are recent. I'm not talking about the weird Lois and Batbaby stuff, but superman's arc.

 Snyder has said that Superman would feel more conflicted and feeling alienated from the rest of humanity when he comes back, he's evil at the end of JL2 and in the first 2/3 of 3, and in JL3 he would become the best version of superman again. 

So just from a storytelling perspective, it's less impactful showing Superman at his saddest, and then lois and his unborn child are killed, and then he's even more sad, and then he bends to the anti-life. If he's adapting parts of Injustice, it is more impactful to have superman at his happiest and his best, in his element, at his highest point, and then he loses everything and becomes evil.   


Also it is really inconsistent from where he was in Justice league, particularly when he hear's the voice of his fathers from both worlds, showing that he became what Jor-El wanted him to be. His theme when he comes back is more heroic than ever and becomes the hero he was always meant to be. 

Comparing it to the arc that he underwent in this current trilogy of Man of Steel, BvS and Justice league, it seems really repetitive. BvS was his moments of doubt and confusion on what to do and Justice league was him becoming his most hopeful self. So what it seems Snyder was doing is just to repeat this arc, because he doesn't like classic superman accept for when he's in the 3rd act.

I personally think it's an easy fix, and it's mainly just to fix him in JL2, which is just have him be hopeful and not conflicted, give a more real friendship with batman and the rest of the league, Bring him up to his highest, and then bring him crashing down. 

One last thing, and I know it's a bit of a nitpick, but If these were ever to be made, I would just keep the BvS and the JL on set suit all the way through. I like the black suit but the red and blue look more aesthetically pleasing, especially when in the same shot as other league members, I think the fan edit of the group shot with the blue suit looks better tbh.

TLDR: Superman's arc in the proposed JL 2 and 3 is weak, contradictory and derivative in my opinion.",1621615351,nhwyhv

DC_Cinematic,Henry Cavill Superman Hate?!?,"I for one don’t give one aorta of care towards who Henry Cavill is dating. Blonde, brunette, black, white, blue. Alien, not alien. Don’t care...But what I’d do care about is both of them breaking lockdown rules in the U.K. repeatedly whilst families couldn’t for over a year. I got a DM asking why I’m mad.I’m clearly jealous! Why would I want someone I don’t know? Eh? Crack on loving who you love. Not mad at that. Only know him as Superman and the Witcher. Had to google his last name, calm down. Looks and muscles only get you so far, with me anyway... For the not rich or famous, in the U.K. we’ve been locked down for 14 months. Couldn’t go anywhere or see family and friends at all! Fined upwards of 10k. 

My cousin had twins who we’ve never met; they can walk now. Dad was in hospital with severe covid me and my mother also had. Jobs have been lost, people on the breadline and homeless has doubled. Food bank usage has tripled. Suicide and mental health problems has increased ten fold due to loneliness and uncertainty. We haven’t touched let alone seen our loved ones for over a year. All made sacrifices. And the community he claims to care about and be apart of. The performing Arts industry I’m apart of has taken massive hits! Theatre stopping for over a year! Films and TV shows in pre production put on hold. Creators, casting, actors, crew all out of work and suffering for it! Not to mention, he created a video thanking the NHS and encouraging people to follow rules for a year. Which he hasn’t done at all! Flying your American girlfriend in and out of the country to go places and get your leg over is a spit in the face of NHS and frontline workers. To then post a scathing post, blaming fans who’ve put you in that position of ‘celebrity’ in the first place. Ignoring and shirking the blame onto others asking important questions. Penalising them for your wrong doings down to being ‘crazy fans’ is so tone deaf and ignorant. 

Black lives matter, he kept quiet. 
Feminism and woman’s rights, he kept quiet. 
Israel and Palestine, he kept quiet.
Covid rules, he broke repeatedly.
But this hating, angry, blameful, self involved post is what he needs to post over everything else? A few comments on social media hurt his feelings so much he needed to write a lengthy post about himself and his squeeze breaking covid rules with him? Things and people’s opinions on something you’ve shoved down people’s throats in the tabloids didn’t go your way? Tough. 

Millions have died and are fighting for their human rights to just exist every day! But breaking rules with entitlement and money warrants tabloids and Instagram post taking up media space and news because you didn’t get what you want? Please, give your head a wobble. It’s the disrespect, entitlement, ego, hypocrisy, breaking rules, shirking of responsibility as an adult for me. Whilst death and disaster happens around his privileged blinders. No one cares about his girlfriend! It’s everything else he needs to answer for! He’s not special! So no, I don’t hate him. I’m not jealous. 

Don’t even know him. We are human. We all mess up. But instead of ignoring and putting the blame on others, ownership of wrongdoing needs to be taken for actions he’s presented to the world. No ones exempt. ‘You wouldn’t say that to his face!’ Yes I would. Fame and good looks doesn’t make everyone fall at your feet like a puddle. 

Here are my questions I’d love to know the answers to...

Do you know you broke lockdown and rules for 14 months?

Flying your girlfriend in and out of the country whilst people haven’t seen or touched family members in over a year. You don’t see a problem with that?

Or how misogynistic, sexist, and egotistical is was to write a post blaming your female fans for being hateful asking the right questions to ask in a situation YOU presented to the world?

Tabloids, Pap walks, press releases, social media posts from her and you. Didn’t you know going public with sketchy information that looked bad in a global pandemic was not going to look well on your part?

Don’t you think it’s a tad hypocritical telling people to get enlightened then behave tone deaf and blind yourself? 

Your relationship posts in the tabloids has took priority over Palestine information and important matters. Do you think people care that much? 

Is what you’ve done and the way you’ve behaved worth it? Whilst millions die and lose everything?

How can you make an NHS video thanking them, then go on to break rules with no repercussion or morals?

Why won’t you or your team address these questions being asked, with every right to, over and over again?

Do you intend to take accountability for your own actions?

No hate, no tea, no shade. But shirking the blame whilst shoving everything down people’s throats in the tabloids and social media is not the way to go about things. And if no one going to say anything, I will. Not the only ‘celebrity’ that has broken covid and lockdown rules. But defiantly one that I didn’t expect to behave this way and do what he did. Lost my respect as equal humans. Do you think his Superman position is hindered by this? Because I loved his portrayal as Supes, but now I’m second guessing the decency of the real man behind the suit.",1621567461,nhiwus
DC_Cinematic,FAN-MADE: Score edits for potential Black Adam composers,"Due to Jaume Collet-Serra's very interesting history with film composers, it's not very easy to predict who's gonna score Black Adam. So I decided to make edits of footage from projects featuring Black Adam, but rescored them with soundtracks by composers who have worked with Jaume Collet-Serra (and Benjamin Wallfisch as an extra bonus).  


I made these a few weeks ago and they were an absolute blast to make. Icould be 100% wrong and not a single one of these guys could score Black Adam. But it's incredibly fun to speculate anyway.  


Here's a rundown of the candidates and how they connect to Jaume Collet-Serra.

[Marco Beltrami (who scored The Shallows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT8vSnSVGHY&amp;t=53s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[John Ottman (who is the only composer Jaume Collet-Serra has worked with more than once)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS35rS7Jodg&amp;t=45s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[James Newton Howard (who scored Jungle Cruise)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UOI4_qupXg&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[Benjamin Wallfisch (Who hasn't worked with Jaume Collet-Serra, but has the Shazam! connection going for him).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcUMLK1pJTY&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[Junkie XL (Who scored Run All Night)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH4kHgABwQk&amp;t=143s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[Roque Baños (who scored The Commuter)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZcHOkj7wWc&amp;t=25s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)  


Again, I could be wrong about all these choices could be someone entirely out of left field. Maybe it could be Brian Tyler, Lorne Balfe, hell, could be Kid Cudi or Metallica for all I know. We got a whole year to find out.",1621567387,nhiw0g

Honestly if you look at his imdb and his track record or lack thereof, there isn't really anything to be that sure and excited about. I'm not saying he isnt capable of making a great batman film, Im just also saying he is capable of co-writing Under Siege 2.

I'm going in to all this with V E R Y low expectations, especially with DC's track record post the dark knight. I know the trailer looks great, but so did the 2016 Suicide Squad trailer.  I've been really excited before, but I've also been quickly disappointed.

First there's Hannes De Maeyer, who scored Arbi &amp; Fallah's first 3 movies. Then there's Lorne Balfe, who scored Bad Boys For Life. And then there's Danny Elfman, whose chances increase if this Batgirl is connected to Michael Keaton. Of course, there's the possibility that none of them will do it, so I leave it to you.

DC_Cinematic,"Discussion: I think that the Knightmare concept squandered the potential of the ""Snyder-Verse"" before it could get its footing.","I've had a while to think about this, and while I still enjoy Zack Snyder's DC Films trilogy, I've come to the conclusion that aside from not agreeing to tell the story over a greater number of movies, the entire concept behind the Knightmare was the fatal flaw that inhibited the potential of Snyder's planned arc. It could have been aesthetically interesting to explore, but it ultimately didn't add anything to what they were doing, and a lot of time was wasted setting up the narrative endgame that could have been used to better set up other story elements and character arcs.

""But it's only a few minutes taken out of two movies,"" you might say. Well yeah, but those are a few minutes that inform where the creative direction of the movies were meant to head in, instead of simply focusing on where the movies actually needed to be, right then and there. *Man of Steel* did not have this problem because it didn't carry the expectation of doing a shared universe, and was instead trying to build up to a sequel in which the character was a more well-adjusted, self-actualized version. Then *Batman v Superman* threw that out the window in favor of showing a timeline in which he's a villain, which the rest of the movie heavily focuses on him being depressed. There was easily a space to explore a Superman still trying to find his footing in a movie that just so happens to feature Batman in it, but it can't be a movie where he goes up against Doomsday and ""dies"". And then in the next movie, we don't even get to enjoy the concept of him coming back fully, even though he resembles a more idealized version of himself, because it's predicated on the future taking root in the present and Superman being a murder machine without the influence of Lois Lane, give or take an Anti-Life Equation - which seems like a gross misunderstanding of a character who was already taking a backseat.

The concept of the ""Superman, but he's evil"" is becoming tired at this point, and as far as I can tell from the rumors about what was going on at the time, Henry Cavill absolutely hated the idea of his arc building up to that, but held his tongue. I think it's acceptable if you're doing an AU version or whatever, but this version was, for all intents and purposes, their ""main"" Superman. A Superman who had already been cast aside in favor of focusing on half a dozen new characters and we didn't get enough time to properly connect to. It doesn't matter that the fourth and fifth movies would have focused on him more - by doing this narrative structure, they locked themselves in to a specific creative direction that I'm not surprised that they pulled a 180° turn on the concept as soon as they were able, even if they did it in a really stupid way that caused a bunch of franchise collateral damage down the road. It became a set-up that just led nowhere, and featured several elements that people already didn't like about the movies cranked up to a ridiculous level.

Looking at the story arc laid out, I genuinely like the final destination of where the story described was headed in (given the omission of a removed soap opera subplot that was frankly poorly conceived): the idea of a sort of utopic world arising from the ashes of Apokolips when the timeline is corrected. But that doesn't warrant spending so much time (a few teases, an ""everyone dies"" sequence, and at least half of an entire movie) on an extended *Mad Max* homage that ultimately does nothing for the story except pad things out by an extra movie. That timeline goes out the window the moment that Lois is saved, and there's not stakes from the sound of things because we know that all the other teammates are going to live this time. And I also think that it's weird that Darkseid, a character who logically would get his motivations and personality embellished by showcasing an evil timeline in which he won, is completely AWOL.

It's not like *X-Men: Days of Future Past* in which it's the backdrop of a single film - there are several minutes of material dedicated to indicating that all our heroes do is doomed to be pointless unless Batman gets himself killed (which we don't know just from watching the movies that we got). From the description given, everything in it is completely undone thanks to a time loop and none of the characters from that timeline actually grow as characters - it's a giant sidequest that most of the characters don't even know happened. *Days of Future Past* doesn't have this problem by the nature of its structure: Wolverine, the time traveller, retains his memories and character development from the previous movies in spite of the cosmic retcon, while the older versions of the characters from the 1970s timeline are shown to have grown as people in the good future, and their story arcs continue in separate movies. Something similar could have happened here - we could have had a conventional Legion of Doom sequel, followed by a huge event that ends the story without having one or the other rely on a cliffhanger.

I think that the Knightmare idea was potentially fixable in some capacity if the apocalyptic and bad future sequences in question ends up just being an extended prologue in the final film, and you have multiple characters go back in time and interact with the rest of the team - something much like the first *Injustice* game. But all the same, that's time that could've been spent instead developing the characters of the Legion of Doom, or the New Gods, or the Green Lantern Corps. There are a lot of story events and characters that are rushed through for the purpose of ""getting to the end"" when several of them would warrant more time spent. And, really, I think that Zack Snyder should have trusted other DC collaborators to help him develop the story that he started instead of putting it all upon himself, only to get completely screwed after they put all the eggs in one basket. That is what the Knightmare concept was: operating on the presumption that everyone would like a darker story and that it would produce billion-dollar hits, instead of focusing on building upon what people liked about *Man of Steel* and going from there.",1621417487,ng1e8n

But the logo also isn't present in Shazam, Wonder Woman 1984, Joker, and apparently the new Justice Society animated film. Apparently nobody from WB even told David F. Sandberg to add it to Shazam even though that film is supposed to be part of the DCEU. I understand why they wouldn't include it for Joker, but why not Shazam or WW84?

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Best and worst DCEU castings,"I wanted to raise a discussion on what everyone thought were the top five best and worst castings in the DCEU so far.

I'll start;

**Best Castings**

1.) Ben Affleck as Batman - He is the best and most definitive live action Batman I have ever seen, from his physique to his lines, his story arc in each movie he's been in and how fleshed out his history is in comparison to other live action Batmen, he's the best DCEU casting so far.

2.) Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn - It feels like Margot Robbie was just born to play Harley Quinn, she just nails the character so well.

3.) Jason Momoa as Aquaman - He is such a cool guy that made a hero once laughed at and looked down upon have the highest grossing DC movie of all time, he's just so awesome in the role.

4.) Will Smith as Deadshot - I feel like Will Smith carried the first Suicide Squad in all honesty, he was really good, somehow both the comic relief character and the grittiest character in the movie, had some of the best action scenes and the best development, I really want to see him return one day.

5.) Jurnee Smollett Bell as Black Canary - She was the breakout character of Birds of Prey and the funniest too, she deserves another shot at the character.


**Worst Castings:**

1.) Jared Leto as The Joker - His take on the character in Suicide Squad was really cringey, felt like he was trying too hard, all of his lines were really corny and unimaginative, he was slightly better in the Snydercut but I just can't get over his weird take compared to Ledger and Phoenix I feel like they both got the character a lot better.

2.) Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor - A good actor cast in the wrong role, if he was playing someone like The Riddler then he would've nailed it. 

3.) Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman - She's always felt really wooden as Wonder Woman, a lot of her lines fall flat and I never really see much acting in her movies.

4.) Ezra Miller as The Flash - I just don't like his take in both versions of the Justice League movie, another actor cast in the wrong role.

5.) Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf - Just felt really weird at times.",1621273147,nemlxx

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: I know most people ridicule Zack's slow motion shots but I think it's so on point in terms of comics book,"When I read a CB, I imagine the scenes in my head in slow motion. Even if I don't, I look at the pictures, right? Stare at them and realize that it's almost like watching a scene in slow motion. So, I think Zack's artistic choice is kinda brilliant in that aspect. It's so accurate when it comes to making a movie based on a comics book story. I don't know if he does it in this context but no matter why he does it, it fits right in. I mean, we were all kids and we played with superhero toys, figurines, legos etc and made them fight each other, moved them in slo-mo, right? So, watching Zack's movies is like a dream come true for kids inside all of us.",1621154272,ndjxmp

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: This Needs to Be Addressed (Sub-related discussion),"I've seen a complaint about this sub a lot lately. That there's too many Snyder posts and not enough posts about all the other upcoming movies. Firstly that's false because there's been more posts about the Black Superman project in the past week than there has about Snyder. Secondly, you know you can make posts too, right? That's what I don't get. The reason there's more Snyder posts than anything else here is simply because there's not enough people actually making the effort to discuss anything else. If you want to discuss stuff other than Snyder, make posts, be vocal about those things you want to talk about. Instead the posts here are either Snyder fans or people just complaining about Snyder fans and how there's too much Snyder discussion. Ironically the latter just adds to the Snyder discussion and continues to take away from discussing other things. If you have enough time to make a giant post or essay comment about how annoying it is that other projects aren't getting talked about, you have the time to make an original post about those projects and encourage discussion about them. You can't say you're sick of hearing about Snyder when all you do is complain about Snyder.

Frankly I'm starting to get sick of it too, both positive and negative. I've already heard it all, neither side is adding particularly original points to the discussion anymore and it's just going in circles. I do think we should be discussing The Suicide Squad more, and The Batman more, and all those films. But instead of writing giant comments complaining about how there's too much Snyder discussion I've instead been spending that time working on a write-up about Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey and how Gunn's film may take the lessons learned from both. I want to talk about something other than Snyder, so I've been making a post about something other than Snyder. See how easy that is? If you want to talk about something other than Snyder, than actually talk about something other than Snyder. It's like you just got passed a bad break-up and keep telling people around you that you don't want to hear about your ex, all while constantly complaining and talking about your ex. And the irony is, you wanna know where I took that analogy? From someone making that complaint about how Snyder talks about WB all the while doing the exact same thing. Seeing that was my breaking point in deciding to make this post.

If you want to discuss TSS, or The Batman, or Static Shock, or Shazam 2, or Black Adam, or all that, then make posts about them, upvote existing posts about them, focus on those things you claim to want to talk about. If you see a bunch of Snyder posts, and you don't want to talk about Snyder, you can literally just ignore them and move on with your day. By taking the time to complain about how there's too much discussion focused on Snyder, you're adding to discussion focused on Snyder. You're not going to convince Snyder fans to stop being passionate about what they love. Why should you? Honestly I wouldn't care if we never got his JL2 or 3. If they happened then I would watch them and probably like them, but I'm not going to campaign for those or lose sleep over them not being made. I'd be satisfied with ZSJL being canon and the Ayer Cut being released. But I will never try to say that just because I don't really care either way about JL2 and 3 that the RTSV people shouldn't either. No, you should damn well support the art and artists you love and never be ashamed of it. And you should never look down on someone just for doing that. It's concerning when people get this mad that other people support something they don't when it's just some movies. I don't support Rian Johnson ever making another Star Wars movie again, but I'm not going to complain about people who do. In fact, I applaud you Rian Johnson fans out there. You saw something positive in his film I didn't and you show your support for that against the swarm of haters. Good on you. Nobody's ever gonna change Johnson fans' opinions, and nobody's ever gonna change Snyder fans' opinions. So instead of obsessively trying, just focus on the stuff you love. If you're really hyped about Gunn's Suicide Squad and feel nobodies' talking about it, then make a post encouraging people to talk about it. I guarantee you more people are looking forward to it than you might think, and they might just need a little push to be more vocal about that. So be that person, give them that push.

It takes a grand total of 5 minutes to write a post that can encourage discussion. So why not do it? In fact, I challenge all of the people who made these complaints that this sub is too Snyder-focused. Make your own post about an upcoming project, encouraging discussion, without mentioning Snyder even once. If you have the time to complain about the discussion on this sub, you have the time to make an effort to actually do something about it.",1621127837,ndd9p4

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: So why did people wanted that Black Suit for Superman exactly?,"A little late to the party but honeslty I've been wondering this since the year the rumor of the fact that Snyder made shots with the Superman's Black Suit happened. We later learned that it wasn't true since BTS clearly showed Henry Cavill with it's normal red and blue, but why fans wanted it in the first place? Was it fan service? Because it clearly looks like it. He wears the suit for no explanation besides that he looks.... Cool ? I guess. We then can make the argument ""well like the comic *Return of Superman* it is used to absorb more Sun radiations since black absorb more sun lights and that Superman, of course dead before lost most of his power and needs regeneration"" but no? He beat the entire Justice League like 5 minutes before and seemed in perfect form so it doesn't make sense does he?

Has someone a explanation for this?",1621105315,nd5z9k
DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Are people REALLY this opposed to a black Superman?,"Everytime I see news of the new Superman movie, I see tons of people complaining and their comments having hundreds of upvotes. I've seen way too many people say this is Warner ""being stupid and not realising what the fans want"" when that's just not what I see. Honestly, this entire idea sounds like a bold and potentially great movie. Racebending a C list character is easy, but doing it to one of your biggest IP takes balls, and I don't think this move was just a quick PR strategy. I mean, they've been planning to make this movie for what, 2 or 3 years?

I'm a huge Superman fanboy, I've grown up rewatching the Reeves films as a kid so many times with my dad he probably remembers them word-for-word. I've read so many Superman comic books in my teenage years I barely bothered to pick up a book. But, I just honestly don't care what race the new Superman is. I don't know what it is with people taking this change so seriously, or why it's so personal to them - but it's just not to me. If you'd ask me to list 20 things about Clark Kent as a character, him being white wouldn't come up. I love the character, and I love his stories, but don't deny yourself of new things just because it's not how you used to like it. Having a black Superman might open doors for a lot of story potential, and it could help the comic book fanbase not take these race swaps so seriously. When Cyclone was race-swapped, people were complaining like it's so serious when the character is barely a C-lister and most of them probably never heard of her before, a lot of these people claim not to be racists but it just doesn't seem like that at all sometimes. I mean, when the news came out people were saying ""make a Static Shock movie instead!"" or ""give John Stewart a movie!!"" when they literally are doing that. Seems like those people don't actually care about those characters, just don't want a black Superman. 

Being white is not essential to Superman as a character, there's characters where their race is important to their struggles and character - but Superman isn't one of them. Besides, this is an anthology movie set in the past that isn't set in the DCEU - this probably won't affect the DCEU or your chances to get a Superman movie the way you like it. I know Val Zod or Calvin could've been a better option but hey, live with what you get. If you really want a Superman just like in the comics, read the comics.",1621103626,nd5dtp

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: About Zack Snyder's recent comments on WB,"I've lost count of how many times I've seen stuff like ""he's like a bitter ex"" ""why can't he let it go"" ""this is all he talks about, why isn't he promoting his new movie?"" etc 

These takes are so confusing to me. He's not just releasing statements whenever he feels like it. He's had dozens of interviews, and in the overwhelming majority, he's talked about his new movie. All his tweets and Vero posts are about it. 

In a few of the interviews, he's been asked about DC stuff. He's been asked, and he answered. That's it. He voiced his support for the new Superman movie, talked about what MoS 2 would have had, and said a few times that WB isn't interested in his take. 

If anyone wants to be angry and someone, be angry at the journalists asking the questions. Even then, it's not like it's a new thing to ask people about their other work during interviews. It's normal. It's been less than 2 months since ZSJL. 

Of course blogging sites take those statements and make headlines of them for clicks. And of course they get posted here. 

""Wow I wish someone was so anti-me they gave me 70 million dollars"" is another one I keep seeing. Are people forgetting that none of that went to him? He didn't get paid for ZSJL. The money went into vfx work, and people who were glad for work during the pandemic got paid. 

As for what he's said, I don't see an issue with it. WB capitalised on his daughters death, lied about him choosing whedon and publicly stated that they think Snyder manipulated Ray Fisher. The snyders haven't heard from the studio at all since release and they've already messed with 4 of his movies. He's well within his rights to say a lot more, good on him for being cordial.

DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: out of these characters, who is Batman’s most underrated villain?","I know there’s more, but I just could put a few.

Poison Ivy: she can literally control all plant life! That’s pretty badass. She’s kinda like Swamp Thing without magic! Imagine Batman fighting her in a forest or something!

Riddler: he’s always been a joke of a villain, but if u rlly think about it, he’s mega smart! Even tho his riddles aren’t the most creative, if u saw Batman Hush, u know what I mean! He scared and forced some of Batman’s main villains from his rogue gallery into working for him so that he could destroy the bat! He figured out who Batman rlly was, and instead of just announcing it to the world, he planned his scheme all the way out! Every detail except Selina escaping at the end lol, but if it worked, he would’ve done what no other villain has done. Kill the Batman!

Clayface: this dude is a beast! He can shapeshifter into anyone, and he’s pretty much bulletproof! He’s like the dc, clay, bigger version of Spider-Man’s Sandman!

Scarecrow: we’ve seen him release his toxin all on Gotham in Batman Begins. Literally everything goes to hell! People killed because of things that aren’t even real! Think about what would happen if it got released world wide! They barely had enough cures for people in Gotham, so the whole freakin world! Everyone would kill each other! And then he’d basically rule the world!

Killer Croc: he’s pretty much the crocodile version of king shark! I think that’s all I have to say to have u convinced! 

Ras’ Al Ghul: and finally, the leader of the League Of Assassins! First point, he’s got a league.. of assasins! Trained to kill and take pain! Second point, he’s a super skilled fighter, and he’s wise! He doesn’t back down, and he’s been living for thousands of years, so he has experience! Even tho his plans down always go as planned, he’s definitely good at being prepared for his plans to fail. 

With all of this said... I’m gonna have to go with Riddler for this one. I just think he deserves more recognition for the crazy things he’s done. I hope The Batman will make me enjoy the character even more!

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZj43rtoEp4


Basically they become all of the info you need for a character beforehand.

Imagine this scenario:  Whichever director goes in for Superman.  The take is the same as Zack's Superman but this time, not only are you showing the campy parts of Superman, but these heroic and strong fights.

Got these near still shots of Superman rescuing families from buildings or saving a kid from a blast from a Supervillain before looking at them with a smile and getting them to their mom.

If every few months, or before a big film came out, you knew another one of these 10-15 minute clips was going to come out about ANY possible hero, I know all of us are going to be tuning in to that.



No dialogue, just scenes.  I think it could be a perfect formula.  Now I think if it was to be done, it would only really be for an HBO max benefit and not really WB.

But there could be SOOO  many heroes introduced.  You never even have to use these characters in a movie.  Especially not right away.

But some director just gets to come out, say I want to make one of these (Probably be a specific name for them at that point.) and no matter the character they get to go out and put their spin and visuals on them.   They could even basically fit in a boss fight in this slow mo style.",1621007333,ncbrx7

Superman Alone has shown in comics to be on another level in the entire universe.

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Rick Famuyiwa would be a great choice for Superman.,"To some, Rick Famuyiwa is best known for directing and even writing some episodes of The Mandalorian. To others, he's known for writing and directing his 2015 comedy masterpiece, Dope. To DC fans, he may be known for as one of many directors who was attached to The Flash and then wasn't due to ""Creative Differences"".

I think out of all the directors who were actually hired to direct The Flash and then bolted, Rick Famuyiwa was the one whose departure hurt the most. I was so excited to see a person of color take on one of DC's big four, but it sadly wasn't meant to be. But I'm usually not one to dwell on what could have been, but I like looking to the future. While The Flash didn't work out, I think Rick Famuyiwa is an amazing choice for the next Superman movie.

I know a rumored shortlist of directors for Black Superman circulated last week which consisted of Barry Jenkins, Regina King, Steven Caple Jr., Shaka King, and J.D. Dillard (Regina is most likely out of the running as she's committed to another comic book movie and Barry Jenkins has his hands tied at Disney rn), but it makes me wonder if Rick would ever be asked. I know things didn't work well the last time, but the people who practically drove him away from The Flash are gone now or at least been moved to other sections of the studio. A major point of contention was with the script, but I think what is being planned with this Superman movie falls completely in line with the kind of themes (both race related and universe) that Rick's past work is known for. And since J.J. and Rick have a Star Wars connection, maybe J.J. is aware of Rick can do with a large scale and visual effects.

Rewatching Dope reminded me of how much a human touch is needed for a character like Superman, which is why all the other directors being considered for the project are great for it. Paul Dini once said that a director like Christopher Nolan taking on Batman excited him a lot more than someone who had a lot of experience with fantasy and action. While Rick has had his hands in the Star Wars universe, he's still mostly known for his more character driven stories. If you haven't seen Dope, you should. Once you do, you'll completely understand why Superman needs someone like Rick Famuyiwa.",1620934379,nbp7xm
DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: questions about bvs,"So, I was rewatching bvs today and seems like there are a lot of questions to be answered. I'll list them out here and love to hear ur explanations.

- Why did the US gov make a big deal of superman's alleged massacre of those Africans when the CIA was going to bomb them anyway?
-The senator believes the African lady when she tells her about superman burning everyone up, so shouldn't she on board with making a deterrant against him?
-Why did batman make gas versions of Kryptonite? Won't the substance be irretrievable if it's in gaseous form? Is there any ballistic hindrance to making Kryptonite bullets, which would be much more effective?
-What was lex's motivation throughout the movie? Did he want to disgrace superman or kill him? If it's the first, why did he create doomsday? Won't fighting  a monster (and possibly dying during the fight) make supes more heroic? If he only wanted to kill him, then why go through all the trouble of edging batman when he could have lead with doomsday?
-Does ww wear her arm cuff only on the left for a significant reason or is it just fashion?
-What sword is she using in the movie? Didn't the og sword get destroyed in her solo movie?

And also, I think superman, despite being the most powerful being on the planet, had a miserable life. He didn't have many friends in his childhood, his dad died while he stood watching, he spent most of his adult life on the road with no significant relationships, he almost died trying to save the planet and instead of gratitude, he got mostly scrutiny. And eventually he died saving an ungrateful world while the dude who said ""Men are brave"" kept running away to save his ass.",1620928303,nbmpwf

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Birds of Prey did not underperform because of Birds of Prey itself....,"There was so many factors involved to why this movie didn’t do as well as it should have. And none of them had anything to do with the movie itself. I keep seeing many people bring up how it flopped because it “sucked”. Which is no way, shape or form true. 

1. It was the literal start of the pandemic. Airports were being shut down, people were panicking, news reports were running rampant about people dying from this unknown virus. Therefore movie theaters were more empty than they ever were and nobody was going to rush to go to a theater at that point &amp;amp;amp; still aren’t. 

2. Warner Bros marketed this film absolutely horribly. The worst marketing I’ve ever seen for a movie probably. The very first trailer was released in October 2019 which was by the way, a horribly cut trailer. It wasn’t exciting and it was very slow paced(very opposite of the movie). The final trailer was released in LATE January(2 weeks before premiere) which was probably worst than the first trailer. It was also very slow paced with a horrible choice of music for a supposed action flick. To top that off, they didn’t market this movie ANYWHERE at all.

3. Also a marketing issue. It should have been called “Harley Quinn And The Birds Of Prey” from the start. 

Overall I just think the movie was put in a very bad position. And it sucks that there will likely be no continuation because of this. I see so many people talk about how they just watched Birds Of Prey &amp; wish they had seen it sooner. But what can you do now",1620880075,nb8dei

DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: ""Evil"" Superman characters popping up in superhero mediums","I know that there are hundreds of superhero stories with their own version of DC Comics (or Marvel) characters that try to do their own take on them. Some of the best comics in general are commentaries on popular superheroes and their tropes. WATCHMEN is arguably one of the most famous and well-known examples in terms of taking superhero iconography and flipping it on its head.

Recently though, there's been a string of superhero media with ""Evil Superman"" archetypes popping up all over the place - including within the various DC Universe TV/Video Game/Film media.  
There's obviously the ""INJUSTICE"" games, which managed to work its way into the DCEU too where an evil Superman takes over the world.   
In the TV Series on the CW, the threat of an alternate universe Evil Superman popping up is what's driving the main antagonist to do questionable things. 

BRIGHTBURN features an ""Evil"" Superman archetype as the main premise in regards to if his alien heritage controlled him over his human upbringing.   
THE BOYS is features an ""Evil"" Superman archetype in Homelander, who is just mad with power.   
The recent INVINCIBLE Animated miniseries features an ""Evil"" Superman archetype in Omni Man.  
Netflix's JUPITER'S LEGACY features another ""Evil"" Superman archetype as one of the main characters.

It's an interesting thing, but what is it with this obsession with seeing evil Superman archetypes now? What is the appeal that's making it such a prevalent trope? I know the appeal in general of seeing an iconic superhero go bad, but why now?",1620868614,nb4u82

It is really sad to think what could have been. The future of DC films look really bleak to me compared to what I pictured all of this would look like.

I think that these could affect his view of what ""truth, justice, and the American way"" means.

That's just me.

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Why does a Black Superman have to be temporary? Why does it have to be black or white instead of both?,"Why are people debating if Superman should be black or white? Why does the movie from JJ and Coates have to be a one time thing on an alternate Earth?


What is the point of making a film with a black Superman and then inevitably switching him back to a white man again in 5 to 10 years?


Why can't we have a black Superman that stays around permanently and builds an actual legacy like Miles Morales did?


If they use Val-Zod or Calvin or some other version of Superman, they have limited comic history and can easily be a clean starting point for a unique Superman story. He can have his own story, and his own journey instead of just being one of hundreds of other alternate reality Superman stories.


They are forced to put this character outside the DCEU if they use Clark, but with Val-Zod or Calvin he can easily coexist with Clark Kent just like Peter and Miles, Barry and Wally, Hal and John etc...


Why put all the time and effort into this character just to inevitably sideline it years down the road? If this new Superman is able stand on his own then he can exist forever and be a huge part of the legacy just like Miles was with Spiderman.

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: “Fixing” Gotham with the help of The Flash,"As we all know, there are quite a lot of things that are currently “up in the air” when it comes to the DCEU, and the Gotham-related aspects are perhaps the most unclear. 

Even though it’s expected that The Flash will help clear some/a lot of stuff up, I figured it could be fun to theorize and discuss how Gotham could be “cleaned” up for future films.

Assuming that Affleck is done after the Flash, and that Keaton won’t be the new Batman of the main continuity, I think there’s another way to use The Flash to establish a new Batman - that won’t step on the toes of Battinson - for the foreseeable future.

**It’s simple - we kill the Batman (and the Joker).**

I realize this will probably garner some strong reactions, but I think it could be interesting. As many of us knows, Dick Grayson was the Robin that died in Snyder’s vision, and as Suicide Squad (and ZSJL) confirms, he died at the hands of the Joker (and Harley Quinn, I guess). 

Here’s where things can get interesting (and a bit tricky). What if, as a result of Barry’s universe hopping/meddling with time, Dick never died at the hands of Joker and Harley. Instead something happened that made him leave Bruce and Gotham behind (opening up the possibility for a Nightwing prequel). 

However, the second effect of Barry’s universe hopping/meddling with time, is that Bruce ultimately dies at the hands of the Joker instead, in some kind of murder-suicide situation (this is probably the part that most wouldn’t like). Batfleck presumably dies a hero, and the Leto situation (i.e. him not really having a clear place in the DCEU with Batfleck gone/Gunn in control of the Squad etc) is also resolved. 

Following Bruce’s death, Dick (my pick for the role would be Callum Turner) returns to Gotham, and ultimately puts on the cowl, recognizing that Gotham still needs a Batman. This also opens up the door for Jeremy Irons to return as Alfred, as he would have a natural bond to Bruce’s “son”. 

And boom, the DCEU has *a* Batman for the foreseeable future. 

Joker dying - thus ending his relationship with Harley in the most permanent of ways - would also allow WB to retcon some aspects of Harley’s story, even though that definitely isn’t necessary. 

This leaves us with -

1. a Batman

2. no “weirdly” absent Joker

3. a Harley that’s single and ready to mingle

4. more of Jeremy Irons’ Alfred

5. a possibility to bring Ewan McGregor’s Black Mask back (should they want to)

6. the possibility to bring back JK Simmons as Gordon/establish a natural way to introduce Barbara

This is obviously just an outline of one direction that WB *can* take, and a better writer than me could probably tie the whole thing together a lot better. 

**TL;DR**: let’s use Barry’s universe hopping/meddling with time to kill Batfleck and Leto’s Joker, to revive Dick, to make him Batman, and to maybe bring some quality actors back into the DCEU.

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: If they were to do a live-action Batman Beyond movie which batman actor would you want?,"I hear a lot of want about a batman beyond, hypothetically speaking which would batman actor/bat-verse would you want the most be in it.

Personally, hear me out I know it's very unlikely but I think a nolan bale batman beyond would be the most hype thing ever. 

Batfleck, with them phasing him out of the dceu anyway it can work. I know snyderverse planned his death but it can take place in an even different earth similar to how doom patrol is seperate to titans though their actors/appearance is the same.

Likely speaking I think keaton is the most possible;  if it happens in the near future. I imagine it's even possible in the flash movie they'll have keaton reference terry mcginis death is why he came out of bat retirement and then they'll spin it off as a prequel.

DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: The problem some of us have, isn't that some people are criticizing Snyder's DC movies. It's the way they do it","This is an issue I wanted to raise for some time now. I personally, don't mind criticism against things that I like. And that includes a lot of the other Snyderverse fans in here I suppose. The only limitation is, it has to be good faith criticism. And that's where the problem is with the critiisms against Snyder's DC movies. 

Have you thought that the reason why all criticism is lumped together as hate and why people push narratives that people just don't understand these movies, is that the criticisms we most commonly hear don't make sense?

Have you ever tried to form a full sentence of your issues with these movies that isn't just an amalgamation of shallow meaningless buzzwords like ""edgy"" ""grimdark"" ""angst"" ""Randian"" ""nhilistic"" , ""humorless"" ""jesus imagery"" and such?

Because when your criticism amounts to just those buzzwords it's easy for me to think you just didn't understand the movies or didn't care enough to pay attention and outright dismiss your criticism. ESPECIALLY when it comes to Man of Steel

Because I recently watched the movies back-to-back and I know for a fact these criticisms are false 

Seriously do I need to make a video compilation with all the emotional moments Clark has in this movie and all the jokes and times he smiles just to shut the ""mopey edgelord emotionless Superman"" crowd?  Because I can do that

As for the Jesus imagery, there's literally only two instances of it in MoS. The scene with the priest and the ""they will join you in the sun"" monologue which can also apply to both Superman and moses he was based of. So basically one and a half

In BvS it's more common, but also anyone who  even slighltly paid attention could tell that this is just a juxtaposition of how people see Superman against what he really is. The movie literally tells you that he's not the god people see him as. But just a guy trying to do the right thing

And if using religious symbolism as a vehicle to make a point is a problem then I guess Jim Carrey is also pretentious right?(bruce almigthty reference)

Also regardless of your opinion of the creative choises in these movies each and every one has a thematic explanation. A reason why the creatives chose to do it(like there was a thought process behind the Zod snap or Batman killing) . So once again the ""dark for the shake of being dark"" argument is null and void

Another rull of thumb I have is that when you use words like ""angst"" or ""edgy"" in an argument, especially a critique without trying to be hyperbolic, you lose the argument. Automatically

Finally let's tackle the ""nihlishm"" / ""depressing"" arguments made mostly for BvS. I still wait for someone to explain to me how a movie that is literally about perservering through darkness and ends with a message that as long as there is good inside some of us we can still all do better and be the best versions of ourselves, can be characterized with those buzzwords

Once again, I don't have an issue with criticism. But next time you want to critciize these movies or any movie, put some effort into it. And at the very least, check to see if your criticism actually applies to the movie",1620669025,n9bdet
DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Why does WB dislike Zack Snyder so much?,[removed],1620660632,n97pnr
DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Who I’d have Jeffery Dean Morgan and Dave Bautista play in the DC universe!,"Everyone is wanting to see Jeffrey play the Flashpoint Batman, but he has also shared interest in playing Lobo. Dave wants to play Bane, but he’s also mentioned ideas of Lobo. If I was running DC, here’s how I’d do it:
I’d have a Flashpoint movie where we’d get to see the story line where Thomas and Martha survive because Jeffery is too good of a casting choice to miss that opportunity! 

I’d then have Dave play Bane in a Ben Affleck solo film or series on HBO Max. From there, I’d then want him to crossover to a Secret Six show. If they didn’t put him in a Batman project, I’d want Ben to have a cameo somewhere in there like in 2016’s Suicide Squad when we saw some of the JL members being responsible for them being sent to Belle Reve.

Now that leaves us with Lobo. I have 2 ideas for him. Emmet J. Scanlan played The Main Man in the show Krypton. I personally thought he was great! He would’ve gotten more screen time if the show hadn’t gotten canceled. I’d want him to come back for the role, but if they couldn’t do that, I’d be ok with a recasting, but I’d want him to either show up in a JL movie so that we could see him in action as a bounty hunter trying to take out the League, or I’d want him to appear in Titans along with his daughter, Crush so that she could join the team, and then try to stop her father who’s coming after her or something.

DC_Cinematic,OTHER: There is a Weird Notion,"There is a Weird notion that Audience doesn't like direction of certain director or Characterization of a Character.The Thing is General Audience doesn't care.They don't care whether it's Spider-Man or Superman or Darkhawk.They want Entertainment.People goes to movies buy sparing some time from their lives to be entertained.Sci Fi Fantasy has always been more successful than any other movies like Slice of Life movies or mobster movies cause they are entertainment.Plot and Characterization comes second to Entertainment value.There is absolutely no problem for directive freedom but when those movies especially in Sci Fi Fantasy region and if they already have any character with some preconceived popularity,there comes the problem .Even that is case by case study.General Audience don't care who the director is.Heck they don't even know.
My point is it doesn't matter if future DC movies made by Snyder or have race swapped characters or connected or disjoint.Those factors will not govern how those movies does.Only factor which is important is Entertainment value.",1620637305,n8zyeo

Let's say Man of Steel happened exactly as is, but then in BVS, Bale's Bruce Wayne sees the destruction of Metropolis and the Wayne Financial building, and, mixed in with a public smear campaign from Lex Luthor, he decides to leave the peace and happiness of his life with in hiding with Selina Kyle behind and assume the mantle of the Bat again, setting up an eventual confrontation with Superman.

DC_Cinematic,"DISCUSSION: If Gotham had started a few years later, do you think the show would’ve been allowed to continue as a ‘Batman’ show after season 5?","It’s no secret that Gotham was heavily impeded by WB’s strict rule against using major heroes/villains/characters from the DC Universe on TV. Like how the rule forced Arrow to stop using Deathstroke and the Suicide Squad and Supergirl barely using Superman when he was introduced, it forced Gotham to be unable to use Batman himself, refer to what was obviously the Joker and other Batman villains by their villain names and constantly refer to them as ‘inspirations’ for the actual villains. 

But recently, WB have gone on the record to say that they’re ‘loosening the reins’ when it comes to stopping major DC characters from appearing on the small screen. Superman has got his own highly successful show whilst another version is getting a movie, they’ve said Robert’s Batman can appear on the HBO Max GCPD show and other characters can basically be used if they want to. So if Gotham had started a few years later and the final season was being made when WB ‘loosened the reins’, do you think they would’ve been allowed to fully use Joker and Batman in the final episode of season 5 and do you think they would’ve been allowed to continue Gotham as a ‘Batman’ show?

The final episode itself already acts like a pilot episode for a Batman show (dodgy Batsuit and young looking Batman aside) and I believe the cast has said they would’ve loved to continue the show post season 5 and recently, watching the Superman show, I feel like WB is missing a potentially successful Batman show. They literally have one with pre established characters, lore and relationships ready to go. A Batman show would already draw in numbers, added with making it a Gotham continuation, they’d be drawing in the general audience fans who were just a fan of the show. 

Only thing they’d need to do is cast an actual older Bruce Wayne.",1620591914,n8mpa9

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Most DC Films forget what's truly special about DC as a whole and that's what's wrong with their attempted universe,"Just look at how many properties out there are filled with some twisted version or alternative take on Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Superman isn't the greatest hero of all time because everyone knows him, he's the greatest because without him none of that would be possible. 

Comic books in general could've arguably collapsed in the 40s if the character wasn't created. And yet WB ignores what makes him so special, inspiring and relevant because they still think that Superman should rather be portrayed as his twisted versions than the hero he actually is.

DC Comics is and always has been about legacy. Dick Grayson, Wally West, Donna Troy and Roy Harper are a few examples but so far how many of them have we seen? 

Superman &amp; Lois is what I wish we had in the DCEU. And look, I know some Snyder fans are going to misinterpret this and say that we need new takes and shit and I could actually get behind that eventually. But why can't we ask for a little bit of both? I'd love to see a comic book accurate Barry Allen, Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen on the big screen just being friends like they are in the comics you know? 

Multiple Robins, Jimmy Olsen, and a lot of other supporting characters that represent us in that world. 

I'm not saying any of what we get is invalid but I'd really like to see a bigger universe that could eventually lead to Kingdom Come.  

All the other brands out there are taking their shots at legacy stuff when DC IS all about legacy. From the Kents to Clark, from Clark to Jon and so forth.

DC_Cinematic,OPINION: RestoreTheSnyderverse - RANT,"What the ...

Is wrong ... With you guys?! What is this movement?!

I am fan of Marvel foremost but i like DC as well, heck any sci-fi or superhero stuff is mostly right up my alley.

And i am not here to indunce non-sense like Marvel/DC war. This stuff is BS. There is no rivarly, and if there is competetion we all benifit from is great and stunning movies from both of the studios.

But for the love of GOD ... Comic Book movies needs good storyteling not visuals. Especially DC ones need their stories to fit ONE narative as most of the DC animated films or comics every one have their very own closed and unique storyline. And it works. And shared universe like Marvel? Might also work just fine, but Zack Snyder is really bad at story telling. Let me tell you why.

!!!SPOILERS FOR MOVIES AHEAD!!!

Man of Steel:Although really good movie overall, it really mised the mark of Superman being a HOPE, being a light in the Dark, original Superman was always thr guy who was there for people with people. In Man of Steel all you got was two aliens duking it out (For god sake even Red Son was WAY better Superman before Brainiac controled him then mannof Steel)

BvS:Do i need to point the obvious? MARTHAAAA, Lex Luthor, Doomsday, Superman Death. Look i DID READ Superman death long before that. The panel where Doomsday punched Superman and came to his name was really iconic. All the characters painted in horor as their hero fighted for death for them, ultimately dying and EVERY hero being on his funreal. BvS? Nah hes ded ... He killed so many people anyway. So many plotholes and so many bad lines. It was painful to see so famous and loved characters buthcered (I dont talk about Batman Killing ETC. I dont care for that really)

Justice League:Snyder cut worked much better then original .. but it was only because it was almost 4 hours long. Movie which would not have worked in cinema. And still it was with characters which were not established well in the very first place. 

And i know all the blame is not on Zack Snyder, but for the studio as well ...

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MAKE WARNER BROTHERS BRING REAL CREATIVE DIRECTORS IN! LIKE JAMES GUNN!

Look at suicide Squad now! Right away its comic accurate and looks like fun movie just from trailers while keeping DC atmosphere on it!

Zack Snyder is not great director to have those beloved characters on his hands! And i say that as a fan of those Characters! I want those movies to have atmosphere of Animated DC movies! I want to see White Lantern! I want to see Speedster Death, i want to see more Speedforce stuff, i want to see Batman struggling with not killing Joker, i want to see Aquaman and his army in actual action and being a threat to human world.

All those intresting storylines would be wasted in hands someone who is praised here as a god while he butchered those characters in the end. I dont care Snyder Cut was at least ""decent"" which is even strong word, he made those characters unitresting and hollow. 

I dont want it to happen for others too.

Also i appologize if anyone got offended by this post. Each time i visit here i see it and i am going into boiling mode and am sad at same time as it is like no-one wants those movies to be good, everyone just Follows Snyder refusing to see how poorly he handled the task.

Thats all! Cheers.",1620565552,n8dvcp

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: My neutral take on WB and Dc,"So, in the last couple of days this subreddit has kinda become a shitstorm, after the news about a potential black Superman/Clark Kent movie. After how mediocre the DCEU has been as a cinematic universe since BVS, a kind of battle has been going on between Dc fans vs Snyder fans vs WB vs critics vs Marvel fans. It is a little bit sad that the best DCEU movies have been the solo movies, that have only had small connections to the larger universe. After how successful the MCU has been, Dc fans have wanted the same thing with the DCEU. 

The problem is, it's not easy for WB to create a MCU esque cinematic universe. Marvel is where it is today, because of Kevin Fiege. The perfect producer. He is like a mix between Geoff Johns when it comes to comic knowledge and Walter Hamada when it comes to business decisions, no one is like Kevin Fiege. I know it's hard to accept that, because we all want a successful Dc universe. Snyder had a plan for a kind of Dc universe, but it was more of a five movie arc than a 10 years of build up. All of Snyder's Dc movies have gotten mixed reviews by critics and audience, and none of his movies made over a billion dollars. So it was not a strange decision by WB to walk away from his vision. 

Now, WB can and should be criticized by us fans. But it's not all their fault. The things WB should get the blame for is giving Snyder the Fiege role of the DC universe when clearly they never had any faith in him. Either commit to him 100% or never give him the keys to the kingdom. WB should never have let Joss Whedon threat the Justice League cast like shit. WB reason for cancelling the New Gods movie was really stupid. But it's not 100% WB fault for why the DCEU has been a failure. Like I said, Fiege is one of a kind. Disney would never have had the success of the Marvel movies, if not for Fiege. Just look at their Star Wars franchise. 

WB is in a tuff decision when it comes to the DCEU. The directors that want to direct a Dc movie, don't want their movie to be part of a larger universe. Dc get the directors (like Matt Reeves, Patty Jenkins, James Wan) that could easily direct a Marvel movie if they wanted to, but don't, because they don't want their movies to be in a shared universe. So now the the Dc movies are kind of in a mess, because we have the old DCEU (MOS, SS, BVS, ZSJL) and the new DCEU (WW, AQ, Shazam, BOP, WW84, TSS, Black Adam, The Flash and AQ2), plus the Elseworlds stories (Joker, The Batman, Abrams Superman movie).

WB could have fixed their universe, if they just cleaned the slate after Justice League in 2017. Like rebooted everything, every movie and actor. But imagine the shit WB would have gotten, if they rebooted Wonder Woman after how successful the first movie was. But instead WB kept what was successful like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam and Birds Of Prey and the actors like Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Margot Robbie and Ezra Miller. So now the DCEU no longer follows Snyder's vision, but still keeping some of his actors. It's all a big mess basically. 

My point with all of this is, it's not all black and white. It's not 100% Snyder's or WB's fault. If you want to hate on WB, that's completely fine.

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Fan sequel novelisation,"I've been thinking about doing a fan sequel to ZSJL in novel form for a while but after that awesome fan-zine compilation of ""The Dreamscapes of Zack Snyder’s Justice League: An Exclusive Exhibit” I really want to do it now, following as closely to the original plan as possible.

However, due to certain changes, not everything in this plan would work, the more obvious being the cut Bruce/Lois romance (I know it was controversial when people first heard of it but I was kind of intrigued by the idea).

So, my question is, what do you all think would need to be changed to make the story mesh with ZSJL but still keeping to the spirit of those storyboards. For example, how would Lois be ""the key"" in this scenario?

Anyway, if you have any thoughts on this, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

I have included a link to the site with those colourised storyboards if you're interested and hadn't seen them yet. Check them out if you haven't as they are awesome

DCEU flash gets his “flash” name from CW flash. So I expect him to appear in some way.

1. He said it's gonna touch on the family stuff. So I hope we see more of Arthur and Orm together.

2. I'd love to see more Balck Manta. Randall Park's character could play a more prominent role this time around.

3. I believe Arthur and Mera are engaged as of now in the current continuity. So maybe the movie could end with a proposal from him.

4. I also suspect one of his parents is going to die. Superhero parents just don't get to live.

5 They have cast a Game of Thrones actor and I really hope he isn't going to be a villain. We don't need a Spiderman3 again.

6. Elephant in the room: IF Mera is recast, I vote for Blake Lively.

DC_Cinematic,OTHER: Don’t count on a ZSJL Blu-ray release in US,"Just gonna put this out there from now: there will not be a physical media release of ZSJL in the US anytime soon (if ever).

The reason its releasing on Blu-ray/4K in every other country is because the movie was not released on HBOmax in their region. HBOmax is a streaming service and as evidenced by Netflix, Hulu, and Prime, they rarely release their content on physical media (obviously to suck our wallets dry, but its good business).

I don’t need to spell it out for you. ZSJL is technically an HBOmax original, not one of WBs same day theatricals. So don’t expect it to happen.

But I would love to be proven wrong, in fact I wish I am wrong and they do announce a physical media release so i can get it. But based on what we know of WB, there are no depths they wont sink to.

Simple: the CW Crisis on Infinite earths crossover is canon.

Think about it: In the small scene where the DCEU Barry meets the CW Barry, he seems fascinated by his suit, saying how comfortable and breathable it looks. The movie will probably feature a scene where he comes back from his conversation with the CW Barry, now deciding to call himself “The Flash”, and goes on to make his new costume (which probably also upgrades his lightning to yellow for some reason, idk, it's a comic book movie).",1620421327,n78wgo

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Potential composers for the next Superman.,"The shortlist of directors for the upcoming Superman project got me experimenting with some music. With names like Regina King, Steven Caple Jr., and Barry Jenkins floating around, as well as the film being co-produced by J.J. Abrams, predicting composers has been slightly easy. So I took some footage from some Superman projects I love (and the only scene from Superman Returns I remember liking minus the airplane scene) and rescored them using music from potential composers.

  
[With J.J. Abrams attached, Michael Giacchino has a solid chance at getting the job. This will make him ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRf48kIfw0A&amp;t=78s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)  
[the second composer to provided themes for Batman AND Superman (only after Hans Zimmer).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRf48kIfw0A&amp;t=78s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

[While Barry Jenkins is my top choice for Blade, I wouldn't mind in the slightest if he took on Superman. With Jenkins comes Nicholas Britell, who could own the emotional aspect of Superman.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUkr0t3JYik&amp;t=138s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

  
[Regina King's name floating around excites the hell out of me and she's my personal choice to direct this film. Since she's only directed one feature (a great one with One Night In Miami), I think she'll pick Terence Blanchard to score it, as he did with One Night. Blanchard is my personal choice to score the movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR40BXgCSUE&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

  
[And finally, there's Steven Caple Jr., whose most high profile project has been Creed II. Thanks to his work with Childish Gambino as well as his work on Black Panther, Ludwig Göransson has a really solid shot at scoring Superman. He's no stranger to following in the footsteps of John Williams, but has also followed in the footsteps of Hans Zimmer. If he was picked, I wouldn't complain in the slightest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Rli4XmGk8&amp;ab_channel=RatCatcherCentral)

  
I know Shaka King (Judas and the Black Messiah) and J.D. Dillard (Sleight) are also on the shortlist of potential directors, but I can't find a single score by either Mark Isham or Charles Scott IV that could match Superman. And I looked.

  
Overall, it's incredibly exciting to think about who is going to musically define Superman next. I remember speculating up a storm about who would score Man of Steel (Funnily, I didn't think Hans Zimmer would do it) and it's nice to get back in that mode again. While I was right about Benjamin Wallfisch scoring The Flash, that was a baby guess and I could be entirely wrong about all the potential composers I picked here. Maybe a wild card choice like Kris Bowers or Henry Jackman will do the score, but who knows honestly? I'm just happy to get a new Superman movie, it's been so long.

  
Who would you like to score the new Superman movie? Do we share similar choices or do you want someone totally different? Let me know guess score speculation is really fun.",1620418903,n77zgs

DC_Cinematic,"Discussion: Did we ever learn about other actors who auditioned for Aquaman, Flash or Cyborg?","So I think my title explains the point of this discussion. Let me start by saying I love everyone that was cast in the respective roles, they've all done amazing work. But I'm curious who else was considered. It always sounded like Snyder very much did get all of his first choices in regards to actors for all the roles, but I know other people were considered.

Like with Superman, Cavill had to audition, and he was up against Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer and Johnathan Groff for Man of Steel. 

Affleck was clearly the top choice, but we know Snyder also talked to Josh Brolin as a backup. Jason Momoa also auditioned for Batman, which is how he got Aquaman.

Gadot seemed like Snyder's top choice, but Olga Kuylenko and Elodie Yung were also considered.

But we've never heard anything for the other characters. It sounds like Miller and Momoa were Zack's top choices for those roles, and it doesn't sound like they auditioned against anyone for them. 

Ray Fisher had to audition, but I would love to know who he went up against, because he runs in the same circles as a lot of younger Black actors that have come up in the past 7 years. Though it's not confirmed, I'm pretty sure Fisher beat out Aldis Hodge for the role, aka Hawkman. The reasoning for that is Hodge did an article not to long ago after he was cast as Hawkman where he talked about how he's been auditioning for superhero roles for the past 10 years. Also, Ray Fisher mentioned that he was in the middle of auditioning for Straight Outta Compton when he got the call for Cyborg, and Hodge was in that film. I'd be willing to bet good money that Fisher went up against a lot of people that have come up recently.

Anyway, if anyone has any info or remember old rumors about who else was considered for these roles, I'd love to hear them. Thanks.",1620405322,n72ppb

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: What DC should be doing to tell a story about black lives instead of making Kal-El black.,"Okay so preface this post by saying that I myself do not know a lot about J'onn J'onzz's stories in the comics, but I think that you could potentially tell a very powerful story by making a movie about the Martian Manhunter. Picture this the movie would start a new DC continuity and would start with the Martian Manhunter coming to earth. Realizing that he cannot walk around as himself do to the attention he would draw he makes himself look human specifically he makes himself look black. He tries to blend into society and begins to see all the racism and violence that black people around the world deal with on a regular basis and decides that with the power he has he cannot sit by and let such hateful acts endure and begins helping people as a superhero as Martian Manhunter and becoming an activist in his life as J'onn J'onzz. Does anyone else think this could work? I think it could be a really good way to tell a good story that deals with race in a superhero film that doesn't feel like the studio is just trying to pander. It could also accomplish something that Marvel did with Ironman and take a character from the comics and push him into mainstream audiences. Thoughts?",1620397943,n6zvcc

DC_Cinematic,Black Superman ideas DISCUSSION:,"

Discussion:


I am in favor of casting the best person for whichever comic character and I’m open to them casting a Black Superman but I don’t a ‘Black’ Superman just to check boxes. I think like you guys, I want the best Superman. Right now, that is Henry Cavill. 

So my idea is, why not skip the inevitable Black Superman hoopla and make a Steel movie. Yea it’s kinda like iron man but iron man is retired and there’s plenty of space for Steel to exist as his own character. 

It could take place during the world without Superman period when Clark is dead. He could fight the Eradicator or any other villain from that story. 

This would satisfy WB’s need to fix their PR problem of appearing racist and expand the DCEU. 

I have no solid casting ideas as of now. Michael B Jordan would be great since he’s the guy they’re pursuing and he’s an amazing actor.

DC_Cinematic,OTHER: I’m and pissed and I need ur guesses help! Idk what to do! I know this is long but plz read!!!,"So I’m 15 years old. I live in North Carolina. I’ve had a rough childhood but recently after going to a boarding school, I have completely turned my life around for the better. My parents wanted to reward me for this change, so they decided to take me to Dallas Texas to see the Zack Snyder’s Justice League Exhibit at the AT@T headquarters! We called the people there a few weeks ago to ask how long it’ll be opened, and one of the guys said “until at least Memorial Day Weekend” (May 31) ive been so pumped for this trip! We left this morning and took a plane! It was my first time flying since I was very young! Once we got there, we walked inside and asked where the exhibit was located and the guy at the desk told me that it had already been taken down! Last Friday they took everything down and shipped the suits and everything back to California!!!! I am beyond angry. The AT@T employee gave me false information that made my parents waste over $1500!!! I tried talking to people there and calling but there wasn’t rlly anything to do! Idk if anything can rlly fix this, but if there’s anything u can think of to help, plz do! We traveled all the way here just for this exhibit!",1620344273,n6l0z6

You say you don’t care about the Snyder cut and Snyder verse and you get shit on. You don’t like one of Snyder’s movies? Well fuck you I am going to downvote.

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Why is there so much denial about Keaton will be the DCEU Bruce Wayne/Batman?,"&gt; “Keaton would play Batman in a Nick Fury-like role starting with Warner Bros. The Flash starring Ezra Miller, and could continue to play the Dark Knight in other upcoming DC movies like Batgirl. Reportedly, the Keaton Batman won’t impact the mythology being hammered out by Matt Reeves’ reboot The Batman starring Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader, and it will pick up his story line after Batman Returns.”

https://deadline.com/2020/06/michael-keaton-returning-to-play-batman-the-flash-early-talks-1202966393/

&gt; “If a deal makes, Keaton wouldn’t just return for Flash but possibly for several other DC-oriented film projects. Sources tell THR that the role being envisioned for the veteran actor is akin to the role played by Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something of a mentor or guide or even string-puller. Batgirl is one the projects in development that could fall into that category.”

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-keaton-talks-return-as-batman-flash-movie-1299668/

Two of the three best sources in Hollywood reported this. Affleck joined The Flash project after. Michael Keaton is going to replace in the main DCEU timeline. Pattinson is going to be Batman in a Gotham in its own world. Why do so many people refuse to believe this?",1620331143,n6g42b

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: True Diversity in CBMs,"&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128996/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_6

What I want to say is.  

Maybe the best thing for these movies from now on.....  Is to go back to the way they used to act in plays.

I offered an example of one of the most diverse films of my childhood.

I'm half white, half black.  

I remember this movie coming out and my white side being disproving of it.  I remember my Black side not really caring about any kind of representation, but on our black side we all watched ""Moesha"".

This movie did what the plays used to do all the time.

Cast whoever the fuck for whatever the fuck role.

Didn't give a shit about race or anything like that.  Just dropped them into roles, never addressed anything about race and moved on with their film.

Maybe what we need....... is for CBM's to just really go all out with it.

Just all sorts of roles filled by all sorts of characters.  Maybe not even some racial point to it.  Just open casting, and taking in whoever is right for whatever role.

If I see a film with every race mismatching their children.  Black Superman, asian Lois Lane.  Middle Eastern Bruce Wayne.  Shit I wouldn't give a fuck as long as it had actors I loked to watch.

Maybe Hollywood needs to give these things a try.  The controversy might be less?

DC_Cinematic,"Discussion: THR is the only major trade reporting this news on Superman, Batman, and Joker.","So I’ve done my homework now and noticed that among the major reliable trades that report on Hollywood news and updates (THR, Deadline, WSJ, NYT, sometimes TheWrap) no one else is reporting on what they are saying in regards to the recent article. The ones that have don’t mention a black superman, a disconnected Reeves Batman, or a Joker sequel in their report. Matter of fact, some of the information the other trades present directly contradicts what THR is reporting. 

Now this is not to say they are incorrect or their sources are incorrect. They may have someone up at the top that know’s the inner details and is simply the first to get the scoop. 

However, if only one trade is pushing this, I would take the information with a grain of salt. Until all trades report on it in tandem, I would cautiously wait before getting rustled up or excited about the news.",1620312467,n68yol

DC_Cinematic,Discussion: Neither Calvin Ellis or Val-Zod are suited to a movie,"Since the Hollywood Reporter article came out which discussed how the planned Superman film will feature a Black Kal El, one of the most common sentiments is ""this is stupid, DC should do a Calvin Ellis or Zal-Zod instead.""

However, the idea of doing an adaptation of either of these characters doesn't make much sense when the characters themselves are considered. I personally suspect that many of the people calling for their adaptations have only heard of them as being Black Supermen who aren't Clark, and don't have much more knowledge of them beyond that.

Calvin Ellis is not a character with a lot of background. The character can be essentially summed up as ""what if Superman was also Obama?""  He's never had his own series and has only very occasionally shown up in various Multiverse related issues. The character is very similar to the classic version of Superman, the only difference is that he's the President instead of working at the Daily Planet, which is a gimmick which would be a stretch to adapt.There's no real reason not to adapt the more familiar Kent version.

Val-Zod has a more substantial history and developed story. The issue with adapting his story however is how intrinsically tied his story is with the Earth 2 continuity, such as his relation with Kara Zor-El/Powergirl and his succeeding the original Earth 2 Superman (a plot which is incidentally similar to Spider-Verse). Val-Zod never had since own comic series but instead appeared as part of the larger Earth 2 comics, which ensures that all of his adventures and storylines are intertwined with the Earth 2 continuity.To adapt the character a lot of deviations would have to be taken, which would change the character radically.

Superman is one of the most iconic and well known superheroes, with his backstory being particularly iconic. [Grant Morrison famously summed it up in four short sentences](https://twitter.com/comiXology/status/401854911903965184/photo/1). Using the classic version of Superman streamlines the need for an in depth origin story. This doesn't preclude the possibility that elements of Calvin and Zal could be added to whatever version we get on screen, but simply doing a straight adaptation of either character doesn't make much sense. 

[Alternatively, they could adapt Earth 47's Sunshine Superman and Love Syndicate, that would definitely be a unique take]",1620291980,n631iq

Since they already had this cover ready to go, it is clear they chose to release it on May 5th either because WB asked them to or for some other reason.

DC_Cinematic,DISCUSSION: Black Superman Shouldn’t Be Clark Kent,"As a Black man, I feel like the recent rumors about this new Black Superman being Clark Kent don’t make sense to me. A Black Superman movie is an interesting concept, but it should be something different than we’ve seen before (AKA Val-Zod or Steel). I feel like what WB is doing is disrespectful to the Black community. I would want a Black Superman to represent what a Black man in America goes through, and not just change Clark Kent’s skin color. Clark Kent and his story have already been established for decades now (and we have a perfectly good one at the moment). WB is sitting back and saying “Oh look, it’s Superman…but he’s Black now!” I feel like WB is doing this as a publicity stunt, and as a Black man that angers me. It feels like they are mocking the Black community. It cheapens the significance of what a Black Superman could be, and destroys the possible interaction between Clark Kent and this new Superman. If this new Superman turns out to actually be Clark Kent I won’t be watching it.",1620287749,n62427
